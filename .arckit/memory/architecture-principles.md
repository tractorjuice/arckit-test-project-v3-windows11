## I. Strategic Migration Principles

### 1. Cloud-First Endpoint Management

**Principle Statement**:
All endpoint management MUST be performed through Microsoft InTune (cloud-native) with Autopilot for device provisioning. On-premises Configuration Manager co-management is permitted ONLY as a transitional state with documented sunset date.

**Rationale**:
Cloud-native endpoint management provides zero-touch deployment, remote management capabilities, and aligns with Microsoft's modern management strategy. It enables remote workforce support and reduces datacenter dependencies.

**Implications**:
- All new devices provisioned via Windows Autopilot
- InTune becomes single source of truth for device policies
- Configuration Manager (SCCM/ConfigMgr) to be phased out within 18 months
- No Group Policy Objects (GPOs) for Windows 11 devices except during transition

**Approved Approach**:
- **Primary**: Microsoft InTune (Endpoint Manager)
- **Transitional**: InTune + Configuration Manager co-management
- **Prohibited**: Standalone Configuration Manager for new Windows 11 devices

**Transition Path**:
- Phase 1 (Months 0-6): Co-management with workloads gradually shifted to InTune
- Phase 2 (Months 7-12): 80% of workloads managed by InTune
- Phase 3 (Months 13-18): Full InTune management, Configuration Manager decommissioned

**Exceptions**:
- Legacy applications requiring on-premises distribution until modernized
- Highly secure/isolated environments with network restrictions
- Specialized devices (kiosks, shared devices) with documented justification

**Validation Gates**:
- [ ] InTune tenant configured with Azure AD Premium P1/P2
- [ ] Autopilot deployment profiles created for all device types
- [ ] Co-management enabled with workload transition plan
- [ ] Configuration Manager sunset date documented

### 2. Zero Trust Security Model

**Principle Statement**:
All Windows 11 devices MUST implement Zero Trust security principles including device attestation, conditional access, and hardware-based security. Security is NOT negotiable.

**Rationale**:
Windows 11's hardware security requirements (TPM 2.0, Secure Boot, HVCI) provide foundational security capabilities that must be leveraged. Zero Trust assumes breach and validates every access request.

**Zero Trust Pillars for Endpoints**:
1. **Device Attestation**: TPM-based device health verification
2. **Identity Protection**: Azure AD with MFA, passwordless authentication
3. **Conditional Access**: Risk-based access policies enforced before resource access
4. **Endpoint Protection**: Microsoft Defender for Endpoint with EDR enabled

**Mandatory Security Controls**:
- [ ] TPM 2.0 enabled and verified via device health attestation
- [ ] Secure Boot and HVCI (Hypervisor-Protected Code Integrity) enabled
- [ ] BitLocker encryption enforced for all drives
- [ ] Windows Hello for Business (passwordless) enabled
- [ ] Microsoft Defender for Endpoint onboarded with EDR
- [ ] Conditional Access policies enforced via InTune compliance
- [ ] Attack Surface Reduction (ASR) rules deployed
- [ ] Application Control (WDAC or AppLocker) for high-security devices
- [ ] Local admin rights removed (LAPS for emergency access)
- [ ] Security baselines (Microsoft Security Baseline for Windows 11) applied

**Compliance Frameworks**:
- CIS Benchmarks for Windows 11
- Microsoft Security Baselines
- NIST 800-171 (if handling CUI)
- ISO 27001 endpoint security controls

**Validation Gates**:
- [ ] Device compliance policies defined in InTune
- [ ] Conditional Access policies requiring compliant devices
- [ ] Microsoft Defender for Endpoint reporting enabled
- [ ] Security baseline compliance monitored via dashboard

## III. Data and Identity Principles

### 11. Azure AD Integration and Identity Management

**Principle Statement**:
All Windows 11 devices MUST be Azure AD joined (NOT hybrid AD join for greenfield deployments). On-premises Active Directory is permitted ONLY for legacy application support during transition.

**Rationale**:
Azure AD join enables cloud-native management, passwordless authentication, and seamless integration with Microsoft 365. Hybrid join adds complexity and on-premises dependencies.

**Azure AD Join Strategy**:

**Azure AD Join (Preferred)**:
- Device identity stored in Azure AD only
- User authenticates with Azure AD credentials
- Supports passwordless (Windows Hello, FIDO2)
- No VPN required to access cloud resources
- InTune management without Configuration Manager

**Hybrid Azure AD Join (Transitional ONLY)**:
- Device identity in both on-premises AD and Azure AD
- Required for legacy apps using Kerberos/NTLM
- Requires on-premises connectivity (VPN for remote users)
- Plan to retire within 24 months

**Azure AD Registration (BYOD Only)**:
- Personal devices with access to corporate resources
- User identity registered, but device not managed
- Limited corporate policy enforcement

**Identity Protection**:
- Azure AD Premium P1 (minimum) or P2 (recommended)
- Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) enforced for all users
- Conditional Access policies based on user/device/location/risk
- Windows Hello for Business (PIN + biometric or FIDO2)
- Password-less authentication rollout

**Single Sign-On (SSO)**:
- Azure AD SSO to Microsoft 365 apps
- Azure AD Application Proxy for on-premises web apps
- SAML/OAuth federation for third-party SaaS apps

**Validation Gates**:
- [ ] Azure AD Premium P1 or P2 licensed for all users
- [ ] Autopilot configured for Azure AD join
- [ ] Windows Hello for Business enabled
- [ ] Conditional Access policies requiring MFA and compliant device

---

### 12. Data Protection and Backup

**Principle Statement**:
User data MUST be protected via OneDrive Known Folder Move (KFM) with automatic sync. Local-only data storage is prohibited for business data. BitLocker encryption is mandatory.

**Rationale**:
Device loss, theft, or failure should not result in data loss. Cloud-based backup ensures business continuity and enables remote work.

**Data Protection Strategy**:

**OneDrive Known Folder Move (KFM)**:
- Desktop, Documents, Pictures automatically synced to OneDrive
- Deployed via InTune policy (silent, user-transparent)
- 1TB+ storage per user (Microsoft 365 E3/E5)
- Sync status monitored via InTune reporting

**BitLocker Full Disk Encryption**:
- Enforced via InTune compliance policy
- Encryption key escrowed to Azure AD (recovery via InTune)
- TPM-only unlock (no password/PIN for standard users)
- USB drives encrypted via BitLocker To Go

**Data Loss Prevention (DLP)**:
- Microsoft Purview DLP policies prevent data exfiltration
- Sensitive data (SSN, credit card, PHI) blocked from unapproved locations
- Endpoint DLP on Windows 11 devices

**Backup and Recovery**:
- OneDrive version history (30-day retention for all users)
- OneDrive Recycle Bin (93-day retention)
- Windows recovery environment (WinRE) for OS-level recovery
- Device wipe and re-provision via InTune for unrecoverable failures

**Exceptions**:
- High-security users may require TPM + PIN for BitLocker

### 15. Incident Response and Rollback

**Principle Statement**:
Every migration wave MUST have a documented rollback plan. Critical incidents (P1/P2) MUST trigger immediate pause of deployment until resolved.

**Rationale**:
Failure is possible; preparation minimizes impact. Rollback capability prevents widespread disruption.

**Rollback Scenarios**:

**Individual Device Rollback** (Within 10 days of upgrade):
- Use Windows "Go Back" feature to revert to Windows 10
- Available via Settings > System > Recovery
- Requires Windows.old folder (auto-deleted after 10 days)

**Bulk Rollback** (InTune policy):
- Deploy InTune script to automate Windows rollback
- Target specific Azure AD groups (e.g., affected department)

**Device Re-Image** (Last resort):
- Wipe device via InTune
- Re-provision with Windows 10 Autopilot profile
- Restore user data from OneDrive

**Incident Severity Definitions**:

**P1 (Critical)**:
- Multiple users unable to work
- Data loss or security breach
- **Response**: Immediate pause of all migrations, incident bridge within 30 minutes

**P2 (High)**:
- Single user or small group unable to work
- Workaround exists but degraded experience
- **Response**: Pause affected wave, resolution within 4 hours

**P3 (Medium)**:
- Minor inconvenience, no productivity impact
- **Response**: Track and fix in next wave, no pause required

**Validation Gates**:
- [ ] Rollback procedure documented and tested
- [ ] Incident severity definitions communicated
- [ ] Pause/resume criteria defined
- [ ] Incident response team identified

**InTune Licensing**:
- **Option 1**: Microsoft 365 E3 or E5 (includes InTune, Azure AD Premium P1, Windows 10/11 Enterprise E3/E5)
- **Option 2**: Enterprise Mobility + Security (EMS) E3 or E5 (includes InTune, Azure AD Premium)
- **Option 3**: InTune standalone (no Windows licensing included)

**Recommended Licensing Tier**:
- **Standard Users**: Microsoft 365 E3
- **High-Security Users**: Microsoft 365 E5 (includes Defender for Endpoint P2, Azure AD Premium P2, compliance features)

**License Optimization**:
- Reclaim licenses from inactive users (>90 days no sign-in)
- Convert on-premises licenses to subscription where cost-effective
- True-up licensing annually to avoid audit penalties

**Cost Tracking**:
- Endpoint device count tracked monthly
- License utilization reported to finance
- Budget forecasting for device refreshes

**Validation Gates**:
- [ ] License requirements documented per user type
- [ ] License procurement completed before migration
- [ ] License assignment automated via Azure AD groups
- [ ] Quarterly license compliance review scheduled

### 17. Audit Logging and Compliance Reporting

**Principle Statement**:
All device management actions (policy changes, device wipes, enrollment) MUST be logged to Azure AD audit logs. Compliance reports MUST be generated monthly for security review.

**Rationale**:
Auditability ensures accountability, supports compliance requirements, and enables forensic investigation.

**Audit Logging Requirements**:

**Logged Events**:
- Device enrollment, disenrollment, wipe
- Policy assignment, modification, deletion
- Application deployment, removal
- Compliance status changes
- Conditional Access policy evaluations
- BitLocker key recovery requests

**Log Retention**:
- Azure AD audit logs: 30 days (default), 1 year (with Azure AD Premium P2 + Log Analytics)
- InTune audit logs: 30 days (default), exportable to Log Analytics for long-term retention

**Compliance Reporting**:
- **Monthly**: Device compliance summary (percentage compliant, top non-compliance reasons)
- **Quarterly**: Security baseline compliance, update compliance
- **Annually**: Full audit for license compliance, security posture

**Alerting**:
- Alert on bulk device wipes (potential compromise)
- Alert on repeated compliance failures (user training issue or policy problem)
- Alert on unauthorized policy changes

**Validation Gates**:
- [ ] Azure AD audit logging enabled
- [ ] Log retention configured (Log Analytics)
- [ ] Compliance reports scheduled
