## How to Use This Backlog

### For Product Owners:
1. Review epic priorities - adjust based on business needs
2. Refine story acceptance criteria before sprint planning
3. Validate user stories match actual deployment scenarios
4. Adjust sprint sequence based on Windows 10 EOL deadline (October 14, 2025)

### For Development Teams:
1. Review stories in upcoming sprint during Sprint Planning
2. Break down stories into technical tasks (Azure AD configs, InTune policies, PowerShell scripts)
3. Estimate effort using team velocity from previous InTune/Azure projects
4. Identify technical blockers early (Azure AD Premium licenses, hardware compatibility)
5. Update story status as work progresses (To Do → In Progress → Done)

### For Scrum Masters:
1. Track velocity after each sprint (adjust from 20 points baseline)
2. Adjust future sprint loading based on actual team velocity
3. Monitor dependency chains (Azure AD → InTune → Autopilot → Migration)
4. Escalate blockers early (licensing, hardware procurement, application compatibility)
5. Facilitate weekly backlog refinement sessions

### Backlog Refinement:
- **Weekly**: Review and refine next 2 sprints (details, acceptance criteria, technical tasks)
- **Bi-weekly**: Groom backlog beyond 2 sprints (priorities, dependencies)
- **Monthly**: Reassess epic priorities based on Windows 10 EOL timeline
- **Per sprint**: Update based on completed work and pilot feedback

## Risks and Assumptions

### Key Risks

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation | Owner |
|------|-----------|--------|------------|-------|
| Azure AD Premium license delay | Medium | High | Order licenses Sprint 0 (pre-project) | IT Procurement |
| Hardware procurement delay (1,800 devices) | High | Critical | Order devices Sprint 2 after assessment complete | IT Procurement |
| Application compatibility failures | Medium | High | Coordinate with Project 002 (App Packaging); test Tier 1 apps Sprint 4 | Application Owners |
| Windows 10 EOL deadline missed | Low | Critical | 6-week buffer (95% by Sep 1, EOL Oct 14); phased rollout Sprints 9-16 | IT Operations Director |
| Team unfamiliar with InTune | Medium | Medium | Microsoft training Sprint 1; hands-on lab exercises | IT Operations Team |
| Pilot user dissatisfaction (<80%) | Medium | High | Comprehensive user training Sprint 5; helpdesk training Sprint 5 | Change Manager |
| ConfigMgr decommissioning resistance | Medium | Medium | Executive sponsorship (CIO); document £2M cost savings | IT Operations Director |

### Key Assumptions

| Assumption | Validation | Owner |
|------------|-----------|-------|
| Microsoft 365 E3/E5 licenses exist for all 6,000 users | Validate Sprint 1 | IT Licensing |
| Azure AD Premium P1 licenses available | Order Sprint 0 | IT Procurement |
| Hardware budget approved (£2.79M for 1,800 devices) | CFO approval required Sprint 2 | CFO |
| Network bandwidth sufficient (100 Mbps for Autopilot, 50 Mbps for upgrades) | Network team validation Sprint 1 | Network Team |
| Project 002 (Application Packaging) completes by Week 26 | Critical dependency - monitor weekly | Project 002 PM |
| CAB approval process takes 2-3 weeks | Validate Sprint 3 | CAB Chair |
| CREST-certified penetration testing vendor available | Engage vendor Sprint 3 | Security Team |

---

## Integration with Other Projects

### Project 002: Application Packaging & Rationalisation (Critical Dependency)

**Dependency**: Project 002 must complete application compatibility testing and InTune packaging by Week 26 (Month 6) to unblock Project 001 pilot deployment (Sprint 6, Week 12).

**Handoff Points**:
- Week 8 (Sprint 4): Project 002 delivers Tier 1 application compatibility test results
- Week 18 (Sprint 9): Project 002 delivers all retained applications packaged for InTune (.intunewin)
- Week 26 (Project 002 completion): All 220 retained applications certified compatible and packaged

**Risk**: If Project 002 delays, Project 001 pilot (Sprint 6) is blocked.

**Mitigation**: Weekly sync meetings between Project 001 and Project 002 PMs; escalate delays to CIO.

### Project 003: Peripherals Update & Upgrade (Supporting Project)

**Dependency**: Project 003 provides peripherals (headsets, monitors, keyboards/mice) to support hybrid working and user experience.

**Handoff Points**:
- Sprint 6 (Week 12): Pilot users receive peripherals (100 users)
- Sprint 9+ (Production waves): Peripherals deployed to production users

**Risk**: Peripheral procurement delays may impact user satisfaction.

**Mitigation**: Project 003 phased approach (Year 1: headsets/keyboards, Year 2: monitors) allows flexibility.

## Tools and Integrations

### Backlog Management

**Recommended Tools**:
- **Azure DevOps**: Import `backlog.csv` for full Azure Boards integration
- **Jira**: Import `backlog.csv` for Jira tracking
- **GitHub Projects**: Use `backlog.json` for GitHub Projects integration
- **Microsoft Planner**: Manual entry for lightweight tracking

### Export Formats

**Markdown** (primary): `backlog.md` - This file
**CSV** (tool import): `backlog.csv` - Generated for Jira/Azure DevOps import
**JSON** (API integration): `backlog.json` - Generated for programmatic access

### Integration with ArcKit Commands

**Inputs From**:
- `/arckit.requirements` → All stories (45 requirements converted to 60 stories)
- `/arckit.hld` → Component mapping (InTune, Azure AD, Autopilot, etc.)
- `/arckit.stakeholders` → User personas (IT admins, end users, helpdesk, security team)
- `/arckit.risk` → Risk priorities (Critical, High, Medium, Low)
- `/arckit.sobc` → Value priorities (£2M savings, 95% migration target)

**Outputs To**:
- `/arckit.traceability` → Requirements → Stories → Sprints
- `/arckit.analyze` → Backlog completeness check (100% requirements coverage)

---

## Success Criteria

This backlog is complete when:

✅ Every requirement (BR/FR/NFR/INT/DR) maps to ≥1 story (100% coverage achieved)
✅ User stories follow GDS format (As a... I want... So that...)
✅ Acceptance criteria are measurable and testable
✅ Story points are reasonable (1-13 range, most stories 3-8 points)
✅ Dependencies are identified and respected (Sprint 1 foundation → Sprint 2+ builds on it)
✅ Priorities align with business case (Must Have = 53% of points)
✅ Sprint plan is realistic (20 points/sprint, 8 sprints for implementation)
✅ Traceability is maintained (Requirements → Stories → Sprints → Components)

**Overall Assessment**: ✅ **BACKLOG COMPLETE AND READY FOR SPRINT PLANNING**

---

**Note**: This backlog was auto-generated from ArcKit artifacts (requirements.md v5.0, hld.md v2.0, stakeholder-drivers.md v2.0, risk-register.md v3.0, sobc.md v2.0). Review and refine with your team before sprint planning begins. Story points are AI-generated estimates - your team should re-estimate based on actual velocity and capacity during Sprint Planning.

**Recommendation**: Conduct Sprint 0 (pre-project preparation) to secure licensing, train team, and setup environments before Sprint 1 kickoff.
