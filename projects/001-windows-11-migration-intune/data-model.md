## Executive Summary

### Overview

This data model defines the comprehensive data architecture for the Windows 10 to Windows 11 migration project using Microsoft InTune for cloud-native endpoint management. The model encompasses device inventory management, migration tracking, compliance monitoring, user data protection, application compatibility assessment, and audit logging required to migrate approximately 6,000 Windows 10 devices to Windows 11 while transitioning from on-premises Configuration Manager to cloud-native InTune management.

The data model supports critical business requirements including security compliance (Zero Trust architecture), cost optimization (Configuration Manager decommissioning), user productivity (minimal disruption), and regulatory compliance (GDPR, ISO 27001, audit requirements). All data entities are designed to integrate with Microsoft cloud services (InTune, Azure AD, Defender for Endpoint, OneDrive) while maintaining data sovereignty and privacy compliance.

This model serves as the foundation for InTune policy configuration, migration dashboard reporting, compliance monitoring, and architecture decision-making throughout the 24-month migration lifecycle.

### Model Statistics

- **Total Entities**: 15 entities defined (E-001 through E-015)
- **Total Attributes**: 187 attributes across all entities
- **Total Relationships**: 23 relationships mapped
- **Data Classification**:
  - 🟢 Public: 0 entities
  - 🟡 Internal: 8 entities (Device, Application, Migration Event, Policy, Update)
  - 🟠 Confidential: 6 entities (User, Device Compliance, Audit Log, Support Ticket, Stakeholder, Cost Tracking)
  - 🔴 Restricted: 1 entity (OneDrive Data contains PII)

### Compliance Summary

- **GDPR/DPA 2018 Status**: COMPLIANT (with DPIA required for OneDrive data processing)
- **PII Entities**: 3 entities contain personally identifiable information (User, OneDrive Data, Support Ticket)
- **Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA)**: REQUIRED (OneDrive Known Folder Move processes user personal files)
- **Data Retention**: 7 years for audit logs (compliance requirement), 90 days for operational data (InTune default)
- **Cross-Border Transfers**: YES (UK to EU - adequacy decision applies, UK to US - Standard Contractual Clauses required for Microsoft cloud services)

### Key Data Governance Stakeholders

- **Data Owner (Business)**: IT Operations Director - Accountable for device inventory accuracy and migration data quality
- **Data Steward**: InTune Administrator / Endpoint Manager - Responsible for InTune data governance policies
- **Data Custodian (Technical)**: Microsoft InTune Service (SaaS) + Internal Database Team (for custom reporting database) - Manages data storage and security
- **Data Protection Officer**: CISO / DPO - Ensures privacy compliance for PII in user profiles and OneDrive data

### Master Data Management (MDM)

**Source of Truth** (which system is authoritative for each entity):

| Entity | System of Record | Rationale | Conflict Resolution |
|--------|------------------|-----------|---------------------|
| E-001: Device | Microsoft InTune | InTune is device management platform, authoritative for device inventory | InTune wins on conflict (local DB syncs from InTune) |
| E-002: User | Azure Active Directory | Azure AD is identity platform, authoritative for user identity | Azure AD wins on conflict |
| E-003: Device Compliance | Microsoft InTune | InTune evaluates compliance policies, authoritative for compliance status | InTune wins (compliance records immutable snapshots) |
| E-004: Migration Event | Internal Migration Database | Migration events are project-specific, not in InTune/Azure AD | Internal DB is source of truth |
| E-007: OneDrive Data | Microsoft OneDrive | OneDrive stores actual user files, authoritative for sync status | OneDrive wins |
| E-013: Audit Log | Azure Log Analytics | Azure Log Analytics is central audit log repository | Azure Log Analytics wins (immutable append-only) |

**Data Lineage**:
- **E-001 (Device)**: Created in InTune (auto-enrollment) → Synced to Internal Migration DB (hourly) → Displayed in Power BI Dashboard (hourly refresh)
- **E-002 (User)**: Created in Azure AD (HR provisioning) → Synced to InTune (real-time) → Synced to Migration DB (hourly) → Displayed in Power BI
- **E-004 (Migration Event)**: Created in Migration DB (manual entry or InTune webhook) → Displayed in Power BI Dashboard → Archived to Data Warehouse (post-project)

## Privacy & Compliance

### GDPR / UK Data Protection Act 2018 Compliance

#### PII Inventory

**Entities Containing PII**:
- **E-002 (User)**: azure_ad_upn, email, first_name, last_name, phone (5 PII attributes)
- **E-007 (OneDrive Data)**: User-owned personal files synced via Known Folder Move (high-risk PII processing)
- **E-011 (Support Ticket)**: description field may contain user-reported PII (names, emails, phone numbers in issue descriptions)

**Total PII Attributes**: 5 direct PII attributes + user files (E-007) + unstructured text (E-011.description)

**Special Category Data** (sensitive PII under GDPR Article 9):
- **None anticipated** in structured data fields
- **Risk**: User files (E-007 OneDrive Data) may contain health data, financial data, or other special category data if users store personal documents in work folders
- **Mitigation**: User training to separate personal vs. work data; OneDrive Known Folder Move targets work folders only (Desktop, Documents, Pictures for work purposes)

#### Legal Basis for Processing

| Entity | Purpose | Legal Basis | Notes |
|--------|---------|-------------|-------|
| E-002: User | Employee IT account management, migration communication | Contract (GDPR Art 6(1)(b)) | Processing necessary to manage employment contract |
| E-002: User | Migration satisfaction surveys (NPS score) | Consent (GDPR Art 6(1)(a)) | Survey participation is optional, explicit consent obtained |
| E-007: OneDrive Data | Data protection during migration (backup) | Contract (GDPR Art 6(1)(b)) + Legitimate Interests (GDPR Art 6(1)(f)) | OneDrive KFM protects employee data during device migration (business continuity) |
| E-011: Support Ticket | IT support and issue resolution | Contract (GDPR Art 6(1)(b)) + Legitimate Interests (GDPR Art 6(1)(f)) | Support tickets necessary to fulfill employment IT support obligations |

**Consent Management**:
- **Opt-in Required**: User satisfaction surveys (E-002.satisfaction_score) - survey link includes consent checkbox
- **Consent Storage**: Survey platform (e.g., Microsoft Forms) tracks consent; satisfaction_score only stored if consent given
- **Withdrawal**: User can request removal of satisfaction score via IT helpdesk

#### Data Subject Rights Implementation

**Right to Access (Subject Access Request - SAR)**:
- **Process**: User submits SAR via IT helpdesk ticket
- **Response Time**: Within 30 days (GDPR requirement)
- **Data Provided**: User receives export of:
  - User profile (E-002: name, email, persona, migration status)
  - OneDrive sync status (E-007: folders synced, sync health)
  - Support tickets (E-011: tickets submitted by user)
  - Migration events (E-004: migration timeline for user's devices)
- **Format**: JSON or PDF (user preference)
- **Authentication**: Multi-factor authentication required to prevent unauthorized access

**Right to Rectification**:
- **Self-Service**: User can update name, phone via Azure AD self-service portal
- **IT-Assisted**: User can request correction of migration-related data via helpdesk ticket (e.g., incorrect persona assignment)
- **Propagation**: Azure AD updates sync to InTune and Migration DB within 5 minutes

**Right to Erasure (Right to be Forgotten)**:
- **Method**: Anonymization (not hard delete) to preserve migration analytics while removing PII
- **Process**:
  1. User submits erasure request via IT helpdesk (typically at employment termination)
  2. IT Operations validates request (ensure no legal obligation to retain - e.g., ongoing litigation)
  3. If approved, anonymize PII within 90 days of termination:
     - E-002 (User): Replace first_name, last_name, email with "User_<UUID>_Anonymized", set phone to NULL
     - E-007 (OneDrive Data): User files deleted per OneDrive retention policy (30 days post-account deletion)
     - E-011 (Support Ticket): Redact PII from description field (replace names/emails with "[REDACTED]")
  4. Notify user of completion
- **Exceptions**: Cannot delete if legal obligation to retain (e.g., litigation hold, financial audit requirement)
- **Retention Override**: Migration analytics retained indefinitely (anonymized), no PII

**Right to Data Portability**:
- **Endpoint**: IT helpdesk request (no self-service portal)
- **Format**: JSON or CSV (machine-readable)
- **Scope**: User profile (E-002), OneDrive sync status (E-007), support tickets (E-011)
- **Exclusions**: Device compliance data (E-003), audit logs (E-013) - system-generated, not user-provided

**Right to Object**:
- **Objection to Processing**: User can object to satisfaction survey (NPS score collection) - opt-out via survey link
- **Effect**: satisfaction_score remains NULL, no further survey communications sent

**Right to Restrict Processing**:
- **Flag**: E-002.processing_restricted = true (new boolean field if required)
- **Effect**: User data retained but not used for migration planning or communications (frozen account)
- **Use Case**: Rare - typically during dispute resolution or SAR investigation

#### Data Retention Schedule

| Entity | Active Retention | Archive Retention | Total Retention | Legal Basis | Deletion Method |
|--------|------------------|-------------------|-----------------|-------------|-----------------|
| E-002: User | Employment + 90 days | 6 years post-termination | ~6 years | UK employment law (6-year limitation period) | Anonymize PII (first_name, last_name, email, phone) → NULL or "Anonymized", retain migration_status for analytics |
| E-007: OneDrive Data | Employment duration | 30 days post-account deletion | Employment + 30 days | Microsoft OneDrive default retention policy | Hard delete via OneDrive account deletion (user files auto-deleted 30 days post-account deletion) |
| E-011: Support Ticket | 2 years active | 5 years archive | 7 years | ISO 27001, ITIL service management | Anonymize PII in description field (redact names/emails), retain ticket metadata for service improvement |
| E-013: Audit Log | N/A (all archived immediately) | 7 years | 7 years | GDPR, SOX, ISO 27001 | Hard delete after 7 years (no business need beyond compliance) |

**Retention Policy Enforcement**:
- **Automated Deletion**: Quarterly batch job identifies records exceeding retention period and executes anonymization/deletion
- **Audit Trail**: Deletion events logged to separate immutable log (who, what, when deleted)

#### Cross-Border Data Transfers

**Data Locations**:
- **Primary Systems**:
  - Microsoft InTune: EU datacenter (Dublin, Amsterdam) for UK/EU users
  - Azure AD: EU datacenter
  - OneDrive: EU datacenter (user data sovereignty)
  - Internal Migration DB: UK datacenter (on-premises or Azure UK region)
- **Backup Storage**: EU datacenter (Microsoft Azure Backup)
- **Downstream Systems**: Power BI (EU datacenter), ServiceNow (EU instance)

**UK-EU Data Transfers**:
- **Adequacy Decision**: UK-EU adequacy decision in effect (as of 2025, UK GDPR recognizes EU adequacy)
- **Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs)**: Not required for UK-EU transfers (adequacy decision sufficient)
- **Monitoring**: Monitor UK-EU adequacy status (could be revoked in future - fallback to SCCs if needed)

**UK-US Data Transfers**:
- **Applicability**: Microsoft cloud services (InTune, Azure AD, OneDrive) may transfer data to US datacenters for processing (e.g., support, diagnostics)
- **Safeguards**: Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs) in Microsoft cloud service agreements
- **Supplementary Measures**:
  - Encryption in transit (TLS 1.2+)
  - Encryption at rest (Microsoft-managed keys)
  - Access controls (Microsoft support requires approval for data access)
- **UK Extension to EU-US Data Privacy Framework**: Monitor for UK participation (as of 2025, UK has not joined EU-US DPF - rely on SCCs)

#### Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA)

**DPIA Required**: **YES**

**Triggers for DPIA** (GDPR Article 35):
- ✅ **Large-scale processing of PII**: 6,000 users, processing email, name, phone (E-002)
- ✅ **Systematic monitoring**: OneDrive Known Folder Move systematically monitors user files (E-007)
- ⬜ **Automated decision-making**: Not applicable (no automated decisions with legal/significant effects)
- ⬜ **Special category data**: Not intentionally processed, but risk of user files containing health/financial data

**DPIA Status**: **REQUIRED - NOT YET STARTED**

**DPIA Scope**:
- **Primary Risk**: OneDrive Known Folder Move (E-007) - user files may contain sensitive personal data (health records, financial documents, family photos)
- **Secondary Risk**: User PII (E-002) - email, name, phone processed for migration communication

**DPIA Summary** (to be completed before project execution):
- **Privacy Risks Identified**:
  - OneDrive KFM may sync sensitive personal files not intended for work use (e.g., medical records in Documents folder)
  - User migration data (E-002) accessible to IT staff (potential for unauthorized access to PII)
  - Cross-border transfers to Microsoft US datacenters (potential US government surveillance under FISA 702)
- **Mitigation Measures**:
  - User training: Educate users to separate personal vs. work data before OneDrive KFM enablement
  - Access controls: Limit access to user PII (E-002) to IT Operations on need-to-know basis (RBAC via Azure AD groups)
  - Encryption: All data encrypted in transit (TLS 1.2+) and at rest (Microsoft-managed encryption)
  - SCCs: Standard Contractual Clauses with Microsoft for cross-border transfers
  - Audit logging: All access to user PII logged to Azure Log Analytics (E-013) for accountability
- **Residual Risk**: **MEDIUM** (OneDrive file content risk remains - users may inadvertently sync sensitive personal data)
- **ICO Consultation Required**: **NO** (residual risk is MEDIUM, not HIGH - mitigations reduce risk to acceptable level)

**Action**: Complete DPIA before pilot phase (Month 2), obtain CISO and DPO sign-off.

#### ICO Registration & Notifications

**ICO Registration**: **REGISTERED** (organization already ICO-registered for data processing)
- **Registration Number**: [ICO-XXXXXXXX] (organization-wide registration covers this project)
- **Renewal Date**: Annual renewal in [Month]

**Data Breach Notification**:
- **Breach Detection**: Microsoft Defender for Endpoint detects security incidents; InTune alerts on device compliance failures; Azure AD Identity Protection flags risky sign-ins
- **ICO Notification Deadline**: Within 72 hours of becoming aware of breach if high risk to user rights and freedoms
- **Data Subject Notification**: Without undue delay if high risk (e.g., user PII exposed publicly)
- **Breach Log**: All breaches logged in incident management system (even if not reportable to ICO) - maintain audit trail
- **Responsible**: CISO / Data Protection Officer

---

### Sector-Specific Compliance

#### ISO 27001 (Information Security Management)

**Applicability**: **APPLICABLE** (organization holds ISO 27001 certification)

**Relevant Controls**:
- **A.8.1 Asset Management**: Device inventory (E-001) provides asset register for ISO 27001 compliance
- **A.12.6.1 Management of Technical Vulnerabilities**: Compliance monitoring (E-003) tracks patching and Windows 11 upgrade status
- **A.12.6.2 Restrictions on Software Installation**: Application install records (E-006) track unauthorized software
- **A.18.1.5 Regulation of Cryptographic Controls**: BitLocker compliance (E-003.bitlocker_compliant) enforces encryption

**Audit Evidence**: InTune compliance reports (E-003), device inventory (E-001), audit logs (E-013) provide evidence for ISO 27001 recertification audit.

---

#### Cyber Essentials (UK Government)

**Applicability**: **APPLICABLE** (if organization requires Cyber Essentials certification for UK government contracts)

**Relevant Requirements**:
- **Firewalls**: Windows Firewall enabled (tracked in InTune compliance - not in data model but can be added to E-003)
- **Secure Configuration**: Security baseline deployment (FR-009) enforces secure configuration (tracked via E-009 Policy Assignment)
- **Access Control**: MFA enforcement (E-002.mfa_enabled, E-003.mfa_compliant) satisfies Cyber Essentials MFA requirement
- **Malware Protection**: Microsoft Defender for Endpoint (E-003.defender_compliant) satisfies antivirus requirement
- **Patch Management**: Update ring compliance (E-015 Update Ring) tracks Windows Update deployment

## Data Quality Framework

### Quality Dimensions

#### Accuracy

**Definition**: Data correctly represents the real-world device, user, or migration event

**Quality Targets**:

| Entity | Attribute | Accuracy Target | Measurement Method | Owner |
|--------|-----------|-----------------|-------------------|-------|
| E-001: Device | serial_number | 100% accurate | Reconcile InTune inventory with asset management system | IT Ops Director |
| E-001: Device | compatibility_status | 99% accurate | Validate against Microsoft compatibility list | InTune Admin |
| E-002: User | email | 100% accurate | Validate against Azure AD (source of truth) | Azure AD Admin |
| E-003: Device Compliance | is_compliant | 100% accurate | InTune policy evaluation (automated) | CISO |
| E-004: Migration Event | downtime_minutes | 95% accurate | Compare InTune event logs with user-reported downtime surveys | Migration PM |

**Validation Rules**:
- **Device serial_number**: Must match asset management system (weekly reconciliation)
- **User email**: Must match Azure AD (hourly sync validation)
- **Compliance status**: InTune is source of truth (no manual overrides permitted)

#### Completeness

**Definition**: All required data elements are populated (no missing critical fields)

**Quality Targets**:

| Entity | Required Fields Completeness | Target | Current | Owner |
|--------|------------------------------|--------|---------|-------|
| E-001: Device | device_name, serial_number, hardware_model, compatibility_status | 100% | TBD | InTune Admin |
| E-002: User | azure_ad_upn, email, first_name, last_name, persona | 100% | TBD | Azure AD Admin |
| E-004: Migration Event | device_id, migration_wave_id, migration_status | 100% | TBD | Migration PM |
| E-004: Migration Event | downtime_minutes (optional) | 90% | TBD | Migration PM |

**Missing Data Handling**:
- **Required Fields**: Reject record creation if critical fields missing (hard validation at API layer)
- **Optional Fields**: Allow NULL, but track completeness % for reporting (e.g., downtime_minutes - target 90% populated)

#### Consistency

**Definition**: Data is consistent across systems (InTune, Azure AD, Migration DB) without contradictions

**Quality Targets**:
- **Cross-System**: Device.serial_number in Migration DB matches InTune device.serialNumber (99.9% match rate)
- **Referential Integrity**: All foreign keys reference valid parent records (100% integrity)
- **Business Rules**: Device.current_os_version = "Windows 11" implies Migration Event exists with migration_status = "Success" (95% consistency)

**Reconciliation Process**:
- **Frequency**: Hourly reconciliation between InTune API and Migration DB
- **Method**: Compare device counts, serial numbers, OS versions
- **Discrepancy Resolution**: Automated sync if <1% variance, manual review if >1%

#### Timeliness

**Definition**: Data is up-to-date and reflects current state

**Quality Targets**:

| Entity | Update Frequency | Staleness Tolerance | Current Latency | Owner |
|--------|------------------|---------------------|-----------------|-------|
| E-001: Device | Real-time (InTune sync hourly) | <1 hour | TBD | InTune Admin |
| E-002: User | Real-time (Azure AD sync within 5 min) | <5 minutes | TBD | Azure AD Admin |
| E-003: Device Compliance | Every 8 hours (InTune check-in) | <8 hours | TBD | CISO |
| E-004: Migration Event | Real-time (created on migration start) | <1 hour | TBD | Migration PM |

**Staleness Monitoring**:
- **Alert**: If Device.last_checkin > 24 hours, alert IT Ops (device may be offline or unenrolled)
- **Dashboard**: Migration dashboard displays data freshness indicator ("Last updated: 10 minutes ago")

#### Uniqueness

**Definition**: No duplicate records (each entity instance represents unique real-world object)

**Deduplication Rules**:

| Entity | Unique Key | Deduplication Logic | Duplicate Resolution |
|--------|------------|---------------------|----------------------|
| E-001: Device | serial_number | Case-insensitive serial number match | Reject duplicate enrollment (InTune prevents duplicates automatically) |
| E-002: User | azure_ad_upn | Case-insensitive UPN match | Azure AD prevents duplicates (source of truth) |
| E-004: Migration Event | (device_id, event_start) | Same device cannot have two migration events starting at exact same timestamp | Reject duplicate (application logic validation) |

**Duplicate Detection**:
- **Pre-insert Check**: Before creating E-001 Device, check if serial_number already exists
- **Periodic Scan**: Weekly scan for orphaned records (foreign key references non-existent parent - should be 0%)

#### Validity

**Definition**: Data conforms to defined formats, ranges, and business rules

**Validation Rules**:

| Attribute | Format/Range | Invalid Example | Handling |
|-----------|--------------|-----------------|----------|
| User.email | RFC 5322 email format | "not-an-email" | Reject on insert, flag in existing data |
| User.phone | E.164 format | "123" | Reject on insert, allow NULL if invalid |
| Device.ram_gb | Positive integer, 2-128 GB | 0, 999 | Reject on insert, flag outliers for review |
| Migration Event.downtime_minutes | Positive integer, 0-480 min | -10, 1000 | Reject on insert, flag >480 min for review |
| Device Compliance.is_compliant | Boolean | "maybe" | Enforce boolean type (database constraint) |

## Implementation Guidance

### Database Technology Recommendation

**Recommended Database**: **Hybrid Approach** (Microsoft Cloud Services + Optional Internal Reporting Database)

**Architecture**:
1. **Primary Data Storage**: Microsoft Cloud Services (SaaS)
   - **InTune**: Device inventory (E-001), Compliance (E-003), Policies (E-009), Application Installs (E-006)
   - **Azure AD**: User identity (E-002)
   - **OneDrive**: User files (E-007)
   - **Azure Log Analytics**: Audit logs (E-013)

2. **Secondary Data Storage** (Optional): Internal Reporting Database
   - **Purpose**: Custom reporting, data warehouse for historical analysis, migration-specific entities not in InTune
   - **Technology**: **Azure SQL Database** (PaaS) or **PostgreSQL 15+**
   - **Entities Stored**: E-004 (Migration Event), E-008 (App Compatibility Test), E-010 (Migration Wave), E-011 (Support Ticket), E-012 (Stakeholder), E-014 (Cost Tracking)
   - **Sync Method**: Hourly sync from InTune/Azure AD via Microsoft Graph API; manual entry for migration-specific data

**Rationale**:
- **Microsoft Cloud Services**: Required for InTune/Azure AD integration (no choice - SaaS model). Benefits: Zero infrastructure management, 99.9% SLA, automatic scaling, Microsoft-managed security.
- **Internal Reporting Database** (optional): Recommended for custom migration dashboard (E-004, E-010), application compatibility tracking (E-008), cost tracking (E-014). Benefits: Full query control, custom reporting beyond InTune limits, data warehouse for historical trend analysis.

**Chosen Technology for Internal DB**: **Azure SQL Database** (Platform-as-a-Service)
- **Justification**: Native integration with Power BI, strong ACID guarantees, Azure AD authentication, automatic backups, built-in high availability (99.99% SLA), familiar to Microsoft-focused IT teams.
- **Cloud Provider**: Microsoft Azure (UK South or EU West region for data sovereignty)
- **High Availability**: Zone-redundant deployment (automatic failover within region)

**Alternative**: PostgreSQL 15+ (if organization prefers open-source or multi-cloud strategy)

---

### Schema Migration Strategy

**Migration Tool**: **Entity Framework Core Migrations** (for .NET applications) OR **Flyway** (for database-first approach)

**Versioning**:
- **Schema Version**: V1.0.0 (semantic versioning)
- **Migration Scripts**: Stored in `db/migrations/` directory in Git repository
- **Naming Convention**: `V1.0.0__Initial_Schema.sql`, `V1.1.0__Add_ARM64_Compatibility_Fields.sql`

**Migration Process**:
1. **Development**: Create migration script in dev environment (Azure SQL Database dev instance)
2. **Testing**: Run migration on test database, validate data integrity, run automated tests
3. **Peer Review**: Code review of migration script (check for data loss, performance impact on large tables)
4. **Staging**: Deploy migration to staging Azure SQL Database, run smoke tests
5. **Production**: Deploy migration to production Azure SQL Database (maintenance window if needed)
6. **Rollback Plan**: Document rollback SQL script for each migration (stored in `db/rollbacks/`)

**Zero-Downtime Migrations** (where possible):
- **Additive Changes**: Add new columns/tables without dropping old ones (backward compatible)
- **Blue-Green Deployment**: Not applicable (single Azure SQL Database instance)
- **Avoid**: Rename columns, drop columns during active migration period (can break InTune sync)

---

### Backup and Recovery

**Backup Strategy** (Azure SQL Database):
- **Automated Backups**: Azure SQL Database automatic backups (Microsoft-managed)
  - Full backup: Weekly
  - Differential backup: Every 12-24 hours
  - Transaction log backup: Every 5-10 minutes
- **Point-in-Time Restore (PITR)**: Can restore database to any point in time within 7-35 days (configurable retention)
- **Long-Term Retention (LTR)**: Weekly backups retained for 7 years (for compliance)

**Backup Strategy** (Microsoft Cloud Services - InTune, Azure AD, OneDrive):
- **InTune/Azure AD**: Microsoft-managed backups (no customer-managed backups available for SaaS services)
- **OneDrive**: User files backed up via OneDrive recycle bin (30-day retention), version history (500 versions or 30 days)
- **Mitigation**: Export InTune policies to Git repository monthly (policy-as-code) for disaster recovery

**Recovery Point Objective (RPO)**: <10 minutes (Azure SQL transaction log backups every 5-10 minutes)

**Recovery Time Objective (RTO)**: <1 hour (Azure SQL Database restore typically <30 minutes for small DBs)

**Disaster Recovery**:
- **Geo-Replication**: Azure SQL Database geo-replicated to secondary region (UK West → North Europe) for disaster recovery
- **Failover**: Automatic failover to secondary region if primary region fails (RTO <30 minutes)
- **DR Testing**: Quarterly DR drill (restore backup to test environment, validate data integrity)

**Backup Security**:
- **Encryption at Rest**: Azure SQL Database backups encrypted by default (AES-256)
- **Encryption in Transit**: TLS 1.2 for backup transfers (Microsoft-managed)
- **Access Control**: Only Azure AD Global Admins can initiate restores (RBAC enforced)

### Data Archival

**Archival Policy**:
- **Active Data**: Operational data in Azure SQL Database (last 2 years)
- **Archived Data**: Historical data moved to Azure Synapse Analytics (data warehouse) for long-term analysis (2-7 years old)
- **Deleted Data**: Data past retention period permanently deleted

**Archival Process**:
1. **Identification**: Quarterly batch job identifies records older than active retention period:
   - E-003 (Device Compliance): Archive records >90 days old to data warehouse, delete >2 years old
   - E-004 (Migration Event): Archive to data warehouse after project closure (Month 24), retain 7 years
   - E-011 (Support Ticket): Archive >2 years old to data warehouse, delete >7 years old
2. **Export**: Export records to Azure Synapse Analytics (columnar storage, compressed)
3. **Deletion**: Delete from Azure SQL Database after successful export and verification
4. **Indexing**: Maintain metadata index in Azure SQL for retrieval ("Compliance record archived to Synapse partition 2025-Q4")

**Retrieval Process**:
- **Retrieval SLA**: Restore archived data to Azure SQL within 4 hours (for compliance audits, litigation hold)
- **Method**: Query Azure Synapse directly for reporting, or restore to Azure SQL for operational use
- **Cost**: Archival reduces storage costs by ~70% (Synapse columnar storage vs. SQL row storage)

### Testing Data Strategy

**Test Data Requirements**:
- **Volume**: 10% of production data volume (600 devices, 600 users) for functional testing; 100% volume (6,000 devices) for performance testing
- **Diversity**: Cover all personas, device types, OS versions, compatibility statuses

**Data Anonymization** (for non-production environments):
- **PII Masking**:
  - `User.email`: Replace with `testuser_<random>@example.com`
  - `User.first_name`, `User.last_name`: Replace with random names from Faker library (e.g., "John" → "Alice", "Smith" → "Johnson")
  - `User.phone`: Replace with valid but fake UK phone numbers (e.g., "+44 7700 900000" - UK reserved for testing)
  - `User.azure_ad_upn`: Replace with `testuser_<UUID>@contoso.onmicrosoft.com`
- **Referential Integrity**: Maintain relationships (Device.assigned_user_id still references anonymized User.user_id)
- **Consistency**: Mask deterministically (same real email always maps to same fake email for consistency in testing)

**Test Data Generation**:
- **Synthetic Data**: Use Faker library (Python/C#) to generate fake users, devices, migration events
- **Production Copy**: Copy InTune production data to test Azure SQL Database, then anonymize PII via SQL scripts
- **Prohibited**: Never use real PII in development or test environments (GDPR violation)

**Test Data Refresh**:
- **Frequency**: Monthly refresh of test data from production InTune (anonymized)
- **Automation**: Azure Data Factory pipeline to copy InTune data → Test Azure SQL DB → Run anonymization scripts
