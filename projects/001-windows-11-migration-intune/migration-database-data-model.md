## Executive Summary

### Overview

This data model defines the comprehensive data architecture for the **Internal Migration Database** - a custom Azure SQL Database that stores migration-specific data not available in Microsoft InTune or Azure AD. This database serves as the authoritative source for migration event tracking, wave management, application compatibility testing, cost tracking, stakeholder management, and custom support ticket integration.

The Migration Database complements the InTune/Azure AD SaaS platforms by providing:
1. **Migration Event Tracking**: Detailed migration lifecycle tracking (pilot, production, rollback) with downtime metrics and failure analysis
2. **Wave Management**: Phased rollout planning and execution tracking across 20+ migration waves
3. **Application Compatibility**: Test results for 100+ business applications on Windows 11 (x64 and ARM64)
4. **Cost Tracking**: Budget management for hardware refresh, Copilot+ PC procurement, and professional services
5. **Stakeholder Management**: Project stakeholder registry with RACI matrix and governance roles
6. **Custom Reporting**: Power BI integration for migration dashboard (InTune reporting API has limited custom fields)

This database is designed for a 24-month migration lifecycle with post-project archival for historical analysis and lessons learned. Data is synchronized hourly from InTune (device status) and ServiceNow (support tickets), and exports hourly to Power BI (migration dashboard) and ServiceNow (migration status updates).

### Model Statistics

- **Total Entities**: 6 core entities (E-MDB-001 through E-MDB-006)
- **Total Attributes**: 72 attributes across all entities
- **Total Relationships**: 8 relationships mapped
- **Data Classification**:

  - ðŸŸ  Confidential: 2 entities (Cost Tracking - budget data, Stakeholder - may contain contact PII)
  - ðŸ”´ Restricted: 0 entities

### Compliance Summary

- **GDPR/DPA 2018 Status**: COMPLIANT (minimal PII - stakeholder contact details only)
- **PII Entities**: 1 entity contains PII (Stakeholder - email, phone)
- **Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA)**: NOT REQUIRED (project management data, not high-risk PII processing)
- **Data Retention**: 7 years for archival (project historical analysis), 2 years active operational data
- **Cross-Border Transfers**: NO (Azure SQL Database deployed in UK South region, data stays in UK)

### Key Data Governance Stakeholders

## Entity Catalog

### Entity E-MDB-001: Migration Event

**Description**: Represents a migration event (pilot, production migration, or rollback) for a specific device within a migration wave. Tracks migration lifecycle from initiation through completion or rollback.

**Source Requirements**:
- FR-004: InTune Feature Update Policies (in-place upgrade tracking)
- BR-008: Phased Rollout and Risk Mitigation (wave-based migration tracking)
- FR-017: Rollback Capability Implementation (rollback event tracking)
- NFR-P-002: Windows 11 Upgrade Duration (<90 minutes target, tracked via downtime_minutes)
- Main data model E-004: Migration Event entity

**Business Context**: Migration events are the core entity for tracking the Windows 11 migration lifecycle. Each event represents a migration attempt (pilot, production, or rollback) for a device. Event data drives:
- Migration dashboard reporting (95% completion target per BR-001)
- Downtime tracking (<2hr target per BR-004, tracked as downtime_minutes)
- Success/failure rate analysis (>95% success rate target per BR-008)
- Rollback metrics (<5% rollback rate target per BR-008)
- Root cause analysis for failed migrations (failure_reason)

**Data Ownership**:
- **Business Owner**: IT Operations Director / Migration Project Manager
- **Technical Owner**: Migration Project Manager (creates/updates events via migration scripts)
- **Data Steward**: Migration PM (enforces data quality - all events must have wave_id, status updated within 24 hours)

**Data Classification**: INTERNAL (migration operational data, no PII)

**Volume Estimates**:
- **Initial Volume**: 0 records (migration tracking starts at project launch)
- **Growth Rate**: ~6,000 primary migration events over 24 months (one per device) + ~300 rollback events (5% rollback rate) + ~100 re-migration events = ~6,400 total events
- **Peak Volume**: ~10,000 events over 5 years (includes future device additions, re-migrations)
- **Average Record Size**: 1.5 KB per event (text fields can be lengthy for failure_reason, rollback_reason)

**Data Retention**:
- **Active Period**: Duration of project (24 months)
- **Archive Period**: 5 years post-project (for historical analysis, lessons learned for future migration projects)
- **Total Retention**: 7 years
- **Deletion Policy**: Archive to Azure Synapse Analytics (data warehouse) after project closure; hard delete from Azure SQL Database after 7 years

#### Relationships

**Outgoing Relationships**:
- **part_of_wave**: E-MDB-001 (Migration Event) â†’ E-MDB-002 (Migration Wave) (many-to-one)
  - Foreign Key: migration_wave_id references Migration_Wave.wave_id
  - Description: Each migration event is part of one wave; each wave contains multiple migration events
  - Cascade Delete: NO - Retain migration events even if wave archived (historical data)
  - Orphan Check: REQUIRED - Cannot have migration event without wave assignment

**Incoming Relationships**:
- **device_reference**: External system (Microsoft InTune) - device_id references InTune device inventory (not a database FK, but logical relationship via API)
- **creates_servicenow_incidents**: External system (ServiceNow) - Failed migration events trigger ServiceNow incident creation via integration (INT-SN-003 per servicenow-data-model.md)

#### Indexes

**Primary Key**:
- `pk_migration_event` on `event_id` (clustered index)

**Foreign Keys**:
- `fk_migration_event_wave` on `migration_wave_id`
  - References: Migration_Wave.wave_id
  - On Delete: RESTRICT (cannot delete wave with active events)
  - On Update: CASCADE

**Performance Indexes**:
- `idx_migration_event_device` on `device_id` (for device migration history queries - frequent in migration dashboard)
- `idx_migration_event_wave` on `migration_wave_id` (for wave progress reporting)
- `idx_migration_event_status` on `migration_status` (for filtering active/completed migrations)
- `idx_migration_event_start` on `event_start DESC` (for timeline reporting)
- `idx_migration_event_wave_status` on `(migration_wave_id, migration_status)` (composite index for wave success rate calculations)

- **Contains PII**: NO (device_id is organizational asset, initiated_by/assigned_technician are employee work identifiers - not sensitive PII)
- **Legal Basis for Processing**: Legitimate Interests (GDPR Art 6(1)(f)) - IT project management is legitimate business interest
- **Data Subject Rights**:
  - **Right to Access**: Not applicable (no personal data of end users; employee data is work-related)
  - **Right to Erasure**: Not applicable (project management data retained for business purposes)
- **Data Breach Impact**: LOW - Migration event data leak does not compromise individual privacy (organizational operational data only)
- **Cross-Border Transfers**: NO (Azure SQL Database in UK South region, no cross-border transfers)
- **Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA)**: NOT REQUIRED (no high-risk PII processing)

**Audit Logging**:
- **Access Logging**: Not required for read access (internal IT staff only)
- **Change Logging**: Required for migration_status changes (track who changed status from "Pending" to "Success"/"Failed" - application-level audit log)
- **Retention of Logs**: 7 years (match migration event retention)

## Data Integration Mapping

### Upstream Systems (Data Sources)

#### Integration INT-MDB-001: Microsoft InTune (Device Migration Status)

**Source System**: Microsoft InTune (Endpoint Manager)

**Integration Type**: Hourly sync via Microsoft Graph API

**Data Flow Direction**: InTune â†’ Migration Database (Migration Event table)

**Entities Affected**:
- **E-MDB-001 (Migration Event)**: Creates migration events when InTune detects device OS version change (Windows 10 â†’ Windows 11)

**Data Mapping**:

| Source Field (InTune) | Source Type | Target Entity | Target Attribute | Transformation |
|-----------------------|-------------|---------------|------------------|----------------|
| id (device) | GUID | E-MDB-001 | device_id | Direct mapping |
| osVersion | String | E-MDB-001 | migration_status | If osVersion changes from "Windows 10" to "Windows 11" â†’ create event with status="Success" |
| lastSyncDateTime | TIMESTAMP | E-MDB-001 | event_end | Map to event_end (migration completion timestamp) |

**Sync Logic**:
1. Hourly job queries InTune API for devices with OS version changed in last hour
2. If device OS changed from Windows 10 to Windows 11 â†’ create Migration Event record (if not exists)
3. If event already exists â†’ update migration_status, event_end

**Error Handling**: Retry with exponential backoff; alert DBA if sync fails >4 hours

---

#### Integration INT-MDB-002: ServiceNow (Support Ticket Sync)

**Source System**: ServiceNow ITSM

**Integration Type**: Hourly sync via ServiceNow REST API

**Data Flow Direction**: ServiceNow â†’ Migration Database (read-only reference)

**Entities Affected**: None (Migration DB does not store ServiceNow tickets; references via external API)

**Usage**: Migration Dashboard queries ServiceNow API to display support ticket count per migration wave

---

### Downstream Systems (Data Consumers)

#### Integration INT-MDB-101: Power BI Migration Dashboard

**Target System**: Power BI Service

**Integration Type**: Hourly dataset refresh (Azure SQL Database â†’ Power BI)

## Implementation Guidance

### Database Technology Recommendation

**Recommended Database**: **Azure SQL Database** (Platform-as-a-Service)

**Rationale**:
- **ACID Guarantees**: Transactional consistency for migration event tracking (critical for accurate success rate calculations)
- **Azure Integration**: Native integration with Power BI, Azure AD authentication, Azure Key Vault (secrets management)
- **High Availability**: 99.99% SLA with zone-redundant deployment
- **Automatic Backups**: Point-in-time restore (7-35 days), long-term retention (7 years for compliance)
- **Performance**: Sufficient for 6,000 devices Ã— 22 waves = ~140,000 total migration events over 5 years
- **Cost**: Estimated Â£50-150/month for Standard tier (S2-S4) sufficient for this workload

**Chosen Technology**: **Azure SQL Database Standard S3** (100 DTUs)
- **Justification**: Handles ~500 concurrent queries (Power BI refresh + InTune sync + ServiceNow sync + manual queries)
- **Region**: UK South (data sovereignty)
- **High Availability**: Zone-redundant deployment (automatic failover within UK South region)

**Alternative**: PostgreSQL 15+ on Azure Database for PostgreSQL (if organization prefers open-source)

---

### Schema Migration Strategy

**Migration Tool**: **Entity Framework Core Migrations** (for .NET applications)

**Versioning**: Semantic versioning (V1.0.0, V1.1.0, etc.)

**Migration Process**:
1. Create migration in DEV Azure SQL Database
2. Test in TEST Azure SQL Database
3. Deploy to PROD Azure SQL Database (Sunday 02:00-06:00 UTC maintenance window)

**Rollback Plan**: EF Core supports automatic rollback via `Update-Database -Migration <PreviousMigration>`

---

### Backup and Recovery

**Backup Strategy** (Azure SQL Database):
- **Automated Backups**: Daily full, hourly differential, 5-10 min transaction log
- **Point-in-Time Restore**: 35 days retention (configurable)
- **Long-Term Retention**: Weekly backups retained for 7 years (compliance)

**RPO**: <10 minutes (transaction log backups every 5-10 min)

**RTO**: <1 hour (restore typically <30 min for small DB)

**DR**: Geo-replication to North Europe (failover <30 min)
