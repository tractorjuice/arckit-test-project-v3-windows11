## Resource Plan

### Team Sizing by Phase

| Phase | Weeks | FTE Required | Key Roles |
|-------|-------|--------------|-----------|
| **Discovery** | 1-8 | 4.5 FTE | IT Ops Director (0.5), Enterprise Architect (1), Project Manager (0.5), Change Manager (1), IT Infrastructure (1), Business Analyst (0.5) |
| **Alpha - Design** | 9-20 | 4.5 FTE | Enterprise Architect (1), InTune Architect (1), Security Architect (1), Business Analyst (0.5), Solution Architect (0.5), Technical Writer (0.25), IT Ops Director (0.25) |
| **Alpha - Procurement** | 21-34 | 3.5 FTE | Procurement Manager (1), IT Infrastructure (1), Legal Counsel (0.5), Business Analyst (0.5), IT Ops Director (0.25), Finance Director (0.25) |
| **Beta - Pilot** | 27-48 | 11.5 FTE | InTune Architect (1), Migration Engineers (3), Helpdesk Support (4), Packaging Team (2), Change Manager (0.5), Project Manager (0.5), IT Ops Director (0.5) |
| **Beta - Wave Rollout** | 49-74 | 22.5 FTE | Migration Engineers (6), Helpdesk Support (8), Packaging Team (1), Hardware Logistics (2), Change Manager (1), Project Manager (1), Professional Services (3), IT Ops Director (0.5) |
| **Live - Closure** | 75-78 | 5.25 FTE | IT Infrastructure (2), Business Analyst (0.5), Helpdesk Manager (1), Project Manager (1), Finance Analyst (0.25), IT Ops Director (0.5) |

### Average FTE Over 78 Weeks

Total FTE-weeks: (4.5√ó8) + (4.5√ó12) + (3.5√ó14) + (11.5√ó22) + (22.5√ó26) + (5.25√ó4) = 36 + 54 + 49 + 253 + 585 + 21 = **998 FTE-weeks**

**Average FTE**: 998 √∑ 78 weeks = **12.8 FTE** (rounds to **13 FTE average**)

### Budget Allocation by Phase

| Phase | Labour Cost | Hardware/Services | InTune Licenses | Total |
|-------|-------------|-------------------|-----------------|-------|
| **Discovery** | ¬£144,000 (4.5 FTE √ó 8 weeks √ó ¬£4K/FTE-week) | ¬£0 | ¬£0 | ¬£144,000 |
| **Alpha - Design** | ¬£216,000 (4.5 FTE √ó 12 weeks √ó ¬£4K/FTE-week) | ¬£0 | ¬£0 | ¬£216,000 |
| **Alpha - Procurement** | ¬£196,000 (3.5 FTE √ó 14 weeks √ó ¬£4K/FTE-week) | ¬£3,300,000 (hardware ¬£2.8M + services ¬£500K) | ¬£0 | ¬£3,496,000 |
| **Beta - Pilot** | ¬£1,012,000 (11.5 FTE √ó 22 weeks √ó ¬£4K/FTE-week) | ¬£0 | ¬£50,000 (InTune licenses Year 1) | ¬£1,062,000 |
| **Beta - Wave Rollout** | ¬£2,340,000 (22.5 FTE √ó 26 weeks √ó ¬£4K/FTE-week) | ¬£0 | ¬£150,000 (InTune licenses Year 1-2) | ¬£2,490,000 |
| **Live - Closure** | ¬£84,000 (5.25 FTE √ó 4 weeks √ó ¬£4K/FTE-week) | ¬£0 | ¬£0 | ¬£84,000 |
| **Total** | **¬£3,992,000** | **¬£3,300,000** | **¬£200,000** | **¬£7,492,000** |

**Budget Reconciliation**:

The above calculation (¬£7.5M total) **exceeds the ¬£4.2M stated budget** in SOBC. This indicates:
1. Labour costs assume external contractors/consultants at ¬£4K/FTE-week (¬£200K/year FTE)
2. SOBC budget (¬£4.2M) assumes **internal team members** with incremental costs only for:
   - Hardware procurement: ¬£2.8M (capital)
   - Professional services: ¬£500K (migration support)
   - InTune licenses: ¬£200K (Year 1-2)
   - Project management overhead: ¬£700K (PM, change management, contingency)

**Revised Budget Allocation** (aligned with ¬£4.2M SOBC):

| Cost Category | Amount | Notes |
|---------------|--------|-------|
| **Hardware** | ¬£2,800,000 | 1,800 devices √ó ¬£1,555 average (Dell Latitude, Surface Pro) |
| **Professional Services** | ¬£500,000 | Migration support (6 months, vendor engagement) |
| **InTune Licenses** | ¬£200,000 | Year 1-2 incremental licenses (6,000 devices, ¬£17/device/year incremental) |
| **Project Management** | ¬£400,000 | Dedicated PM, change manager (18 months) |
| **Contingency (10%)** | ¬£300,000 | Risk buffer for hardware delays, rework, extended support |
| **Total** | **¬£4,200,000** | Matches SOBC budget (capital ¬£2.8M, operational ¬£1.4M) |

**Assumptions for Budget Alignment**:
- Internal team members (Enterprise Architect, InTune Architect, IT Ops Director, Helpdesk) are **shared resources**, minimal incremental cost
- External contractors hired for peak periods only (Wave Rollout: 3 FTE √ó 6 months = ¬£360K included in ¬£400K PM overhead)
- Professional services vendor provides 3 FTE migration engineers (included in ¬£500K services contract)

---

## Timeline Estimates & Assumptions

### Project Duration: 78 Weeks (18 Months)

**Breakdown by Phase**:
- Discovery: 8 weeks (10% of timeline)
- Alpha - Design: 12 weeks (15% of timeline)
- Alpha - Procurement: 14 weeks (18% of timeline)
- Beta - Pilot: 22 weeks (28% of timeline) - **Includes Project 002 dependency wait**
- Beta - Wave Rollout: 26 weeks (33% of timeline) - **Critical path**
- Live - Closure: 4 weeks (5% of timeline)

**Critical Path**: Beta - Wave Rollout (Weeks 49-74, 26 weeks) is the longest phase, driven by 5-wave deployment schedule (500 ‚Üí 1,000 ‚Üí 1,500 ‚Üí 1,500 ‚Üí 1,200 devices). Any delays in wave rollout directly impact Windows 10 EOL deadline (Oct 14, 2025).

### Key Assumptions

1. **Project 002 Dependency**: Assumes Project 002 (Application Packaging) completes on schedule by Week 26, delivering 220 apps ready for InTune
2. **Hardware Procurement**: Assumes 12-week lead time for 1,800 devices, vendors can deliver on schedule (Week 40-46)
3. **Autopilot Adoption**: Assumes 95% user adoption of Autopilot (user-initiated deployment), 5% require IT-assisted migration
4. **Application Compatibility**: Assumes <5% applications have issues during pilot, resolved by Project 002 packaging team hypercare
5. **User Training**: Assumes 80% users can self-serve with online training, 20% require 1:1 helpdesk support
6. **Support Capacity**: Assumes helpdesk can handle 2% ticket rate (12 tickets per 600 users per wave = 1 ticket per 50 users)
7. **Hardware Compatibility**: Assumes 70% devices Windows 11 compatible, 30% require replacement (confirmed by hardware assessment)
8. **Windows 10 EOL Deadline**: Hard deadline October 14, 2025 (Week 75), with 6-week buffer (Sep 1, 2025 target = Week 74)

### Risk Factors Affecting Timeline

| Risk | Impact on Timeline | Mitigation |
|------|-------------------|------------|
| **Project 002 delays** (apps not ready Week 26) | +4-8 weeks | Weekly sync with Project 002, escalate to CIO if behind schedule |
| **Hardware procurement delays** (>12 weeks) | +2-4 weeks | Pre-order hardware in Alpha (Week 27), multiple vendor contracts |
| **Pilot failure** (deployment success <90%) | +4-8 weeks | Phased pilot (3 groups), issue resolution between groups |
| **Wave rollout slower than planned** | +4-12 weeks | Add migration engineers (6 FTE ‚Üí 9 FTE), extend vendor support |
| **Application compatibility issues** | +2-6 weeks | Project 002 hypercare support (4 weeks per wave), emergency repackaging |
| **User resistance** (training, change management) | +2-4 weeks | Enhanced change management, executive sponsorship, incentives |
| **Windows 10 EOL deadline missed** | **CRITICAL** | Emergency Extended Security Updates (ESU) purchase (¬£25/device/year) |

**Contingency**: 78-week plan includes **4-week buffer** in wave rollout (5% contingency). If critical path extends >4 weeks, escalate to CIO for:
1. **Option A**: Accelerate wave rollout (add resources, reduce wave intervals from 4-6 weeks to 3-4 weeks)
2. **Option B**: Accept 90-94% migration by EOL, purchase ESU for stragglers (¬£25/device √ó 300 = ¬£7,500/year)
3. **Option C**: Reduce scope (defer non-critical devices like kiosks, accept 85-90% migration)

## Integration with Project 002 (Application Packaging)

### Dependency Relationship

**Project 002 (Application Packaging)** is a **critical prerequisite** for **Project 001 (Windows 11 Migration)** pilot deployment. Project 001 cannot proceed with pilot (Week 27) until Project 002 delivers packaged applications (Week 26).

### Parallel Execution Model

**Weeks 1-26**: Project 001 (Discovery + Alpha Design/Procurement) runs in parallel with Project 002 (Discovery ‚Üí Packaging ‚Üí Testing)
- **No blocking dependency** during this period
- Weekly sync meetings to coordinate integration (30 minutes, IT Ops Director chairs)

**Week 26**: Project 002 Handover Gate
- **Handover Criteria**: 220 apps packaged, pilot validated, documentation complete
- **Outcome**: Project 001 receives packaged apps, proceeds with pilot (Week 27)

**Weeks 27-48**: Project 001 Pilot runs with Project 002 hypercare support
- **Project 002 Team**: 2 FTE packaging engineers provide hypercare support (4 weeks per pilot group)
- **Support Model**: Emergency repackaging, policy adjustments, ISV vendor engagement

**Weeks 49+**: Project 001 Wave Rollout with Project 002 BAU support
- **Project 002 Team**: 1 FTE packaging engineer provides ongoing support
- **Support Model**: Minor packaging fixes, new app onboarding (ongoing)

### Communication & Coordination

- **Weekly Sync**: IT Operations Director chairs joint Project 001 + Project 002 sync (30 minutes)
- **Shared Steering Committee**: CIO, IT Ops Director, Enterprise Architect oversee both projects
- **Shared Risks**: Application compatibility risks managed jointly
- **Budget Coordination**: CFO tracks combined budget (Project 001 ¬£4.2M + Project 002 ¬£231K = ¬£4.43M total)

### Escalation Path

**If Project 002 at risk** (Week 20 checkpoint):
- **Scenario**: Project 002 behind schedule, Week 26 handover at risk
- **Escalation**: CIO convenes emergency steering committee
- **Options**:
  1. **Reallocate Resources**: Add 3rd packaging engineer to Project 002 (¬£30K), accelerate packaging
  2. **Reduce Scope**: Pilot with 150 apps (Tier 1 only), defer Tier 2/3 to Wave 2
  3. **Delay Project 001 Pilot**: Extend Project 001 by 4 weeks (Week 27 ‚Üí Week 31), maintain EOL buffer
