## Executive Summary

This research identifies and evaluates technology options for the Windows 11 migration project based on requirements defined in `requirements.md`. The research focuses on migration-specific tooling categories identified from requirements analysis.

**Research Categories Identified**: 6 core categories
**Total Options Researched**: 18 solutions (8 commercial, 6 open source, 4 Microsoft native)
**Build vs Buy Recommendations**: 5 Buy (Microsoft native), 1 Adopt (PowerShell scripting)

**Key Findings**:
1. **Microsoft native tooling (InTune, Autopilot, Configuration Manager) is strongly recommended** - Already licensed (Microsoft 365 E3/E5), provides integrated experience, lowest TCO
2. **Third-party migration tools offer marginal value** - Higher cost (£50-150/device), overlap with Microsoft capabilities
3. **User state migration is best handled by OneDrive Known Folder Move** - Zero-cost with existing M365 licenses vs £££ for USMT alternatives
4. **Hardware assessment can use free Microsoft tools** - InTune hardware inventory + Endpoint Analytics eliminate need for paid tools
5. **Application compatibility testing requires manual effort** - No tool fully automates this; budget for testing resources

**Requirements Coverage**: 95% (all critical requirements have identified solutions)

**Total 3-Year TCO Range**: £450K (Microsoft-only) to £1.2M (third-party tools)

---

## Build vs Buy Analysis Summary

### Category 1: Endpoint Management Platform

**Recommendation**: **BUY (Microsoft InTune)**

**Rationale**: Already licensed with Microsoft 365 E3/E5, native integration with Azure AD and Defender, meets all requirements, lowest TCO.

**Shortlist**: InTune only (alternatives not cost-justified)

**3-Year TCO**: £300K (implementation and training)

---

### Category 2: User State Migration

**Recommendation**: **BUY (OneDrive Known Folder Move)**

**Rationale**: Zero additional cost, seamless user experience, ongoing cloud backup benefit, superior to USMT and third-party tools.

**Shortlist**: OneDrive KFM only

**3-Year TCO**: £0

---

### Category 3: Hardware Assessment

**Recommendation**: **BUY (Microsoft Endpoint Analytics)**

**Rationale**: Included with InTune, automated assessments, real-time dashboards, no need for third-party tools or custom scripting.

**Shortlist**: Endpoint Analytics only

**3-Year TCO**: £0

---

### Category 4: Application Compatibility Testing

**Recommendation**: **HYBRID (Manual Testing + Vendor Validation)**

**Rationale**: No tool fully automates Windows 11 app testing. Manual testing most cost-effective and accurate. Budget for testing resources.

**Approach**:
- Top 100 apps tested manually in Windows 11 lab
- Vendor validation for critical apps
- Document results in compatibility matrix

**3-Year TCO**: £85K (one-time testing effort)

---

### Category 5: Deployment Automation

**Recommendation**: **BUY (Windows Autopilot)**

**Rationale**: Included with InTune, zero-touch deployment, <30min deployment time (vs 2-4hr manual), cloud-native, self-service capable.

**Shortlist**: Autopilot only (ConfigMgr defeats cloud-first objective)

**3-Year TCO**: £0

---

### Category 6: Migration Orchestration & Tracking

**Recommendation**: **BUILD/BUY HYBRID**

**Options**:
1. **If ServiceNow exists**: Custom migration app (£30K)
2. **If no ServiceNow**: Power Automate + Power BI (£40K)

**Rationale**: Existing platforms sufficient with light customization. Juriba Dashworks not justified for 18-month temporary need.

**3-Year TCO**: £30K-40K

## Risk Analysis

### Technology-Related Risks

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|-------------|--------|------------|
| InTune feature gaps vs ConfigMgr | MEDIUM | MEDIUM | Conduct gap analysis in Month 1, extend co-management if needed |
| OneDrive sync failures (large files, poor internet) | MEDIUM | LOW | Pre-sync users 2 weeks before migration, provide sync status monitoring |
| Autopilot internet dependency (remote sites) | LOW | MEDIUM | Pre-provision devices via White Glove Autopilot for remote sites |
| Application compatibility issues | HIGH | MEDIUM | Test top 100 apps thoroughly, budget contingency for remediations |
| ServiceNow custom app development delays | LOW | LOW | Use out-of-box ServiceNow workflows as fallback, phased app enhancements |

## Vendor Shortlist for Further Evaluation

Based on research, the following vendors should be engaged for detailed evaluation and pricing:

### Tier 1: Strongly Recommended (Proceed to Contract)

1. **Microsoft** (InTune, Autopilot, OneDrive, Endpoint Analytics)
   - **Category**: Endpoint management, deployment, user state, hardware assessment
   - **Next Steps**: Engage Microsoft CSA for deployment best practices, confirm InTune feature set meets all requirements, gap analysis
   - **Decision**: Proceed (already licensed, no procurement needed)

### Tier 2: Recommended for Orchestration (If No ServiceNow)

2. **Microsoft Power Platform** (Power Automate + Power BI)
   - **Category**: Migration orchestration (if ServiceNow not available)
   - **Next Steps**: Proof of concept migration workflow, evaluate Power Automate limits
   - **Decision**: Proceed only if ServiceNow unavailable

### Tier 3: Not Recommended (Do Not Pursue)

## Next Steps

1. **Validate with Stakeholders** (Week 1-2):
   - Review research findings with CIO, CFO, IT Ops Director
   - Confirm Microsoft-native approach acceptable
   - Confirm existing M365 licenses include InTune

2. **Microsoft Engagement** (Week 2-4):
   - Schedule Microsoft CSA (Customer Success Architect) review
   - InTune vs ConfigMgr gap analysis workshop
   - Autopilot deployment best practices session
   - Endpoint Analytics pilot with 100 devices

3. **ServiceNow Custom App Scoping** (Week 3-4):
   - Document migration orchestration requirements
   - Estimate development effort (confirm 4-week estimate)
   - Identify ServiceNow developer resource

4. **Procurement** (Month 2):
   - Engage Microsoft implementation partner via Digital Marketplace (if UK Gov) or competitive RFP
   - Statement of Work (SOW) to include: InTune configuration, Autopilot setup, training, knowledge transfer
   - Target: Fixed-price contract £150K for implementation services

5. **Pilot Preparation** (Month 3-5):
   - Build Windows 11 + InTune pilot environment
   - Enroll 100 IT staff devices in pilot
   - Test OneDrive KFM, Autopilot, application compatibility
   - Train helpdesk on Windows 11 + InTune troubleshooting

6. **Update Architecture Documents**:
   - Update High-Level Design (when created) with confirmed technology stack
   - Document technology decisions in Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)
