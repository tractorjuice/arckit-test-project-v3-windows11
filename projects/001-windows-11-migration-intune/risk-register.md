## ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL CORRECTION NOTICE - RISK REGISTER SUPERSEDED

**This risk register has been CORRECTED to reflect that MOD Secure by Design (SbD) CAAT registration is NOT REQUIRED for this project.**

**Previous Assessment (v2.0 - 2025-10-21)**: INCORRECT - Assumed CAAT registration and MOD SbD framework risks applied to this Windows 11 migration project.

**Corrected Assessment (v3.0 - 2025-10-28)**: This project is delivering **changes to an EXISTING accredited in-service system** (Windows 10 enterprise environment), NOT a NEW operational capability. Therefore:

**RISKS REMOVED (NOT APPLICABLE):**
- ‚ùå **R-001 (v2.0): CAAT registration risk** - CAAT not required (only for NEW operational capabilities)
- ‚ùå **R-002 (v2.0): DTSL appointment risk** - DTSL not required (not a MOD SbD programme)
- ‚ùå **R-004 (v2.0): BIA for CAAT risk** - BIA for CAAT not required
- ‚ùå **R-006 (v2.0): ISN 2023/10 supplier attestation risk** - Not a MOD programme

**RISKS UPDATED:**
- ‚úÖ **R-003: Timeline risk** - Security prep timeline reduced from 3 months to 2 months (CAAT overhead removed)
- ‚úÖ **R-004 (NEW): Security Impact Assessment risk** - Using organizational template (not CAAT BIA)
- ‚úÖ **R-005: Threat model risk** - Owner changed from DTSL to Project Security Lead
- ‚úÖ **R-007: Vendor selection risk** - Criteria changed from CAAT expertise to organizational security governance experience

**Result**: **Total risks reduced from 22 ‚Üí 18 risks**. Critical risks reduced from 3 ‚Üí 1. Overall residual risk reduced from 193 ‚Üí 130 (33% improvement).

## C. Detailed Risk Profiles

### Risk R-001: CAB Approval Delayed (NEW - Replaces v2.0 R-001 CAAT) ‚ö†Ô∏è MEDIUM

**Category:** COMPLIANCE | **Status:** Open | **Owner:** IT Operations Director

**Risk Description:**
Change Advisory Board (CAB) approval for Windows 11 migration delayed due to incomplete Security Impact Assessment, stakeholder concerns, or CAB meeting capacity constraints. CAB approval is mandatory organizational gate before Beta phase for changes to existing accredited systems.

**Root Cause:** Security Impact Assessment template must be completed with threat model, Architecture Review, and stakeholder sign-offs before CAB submission.

**Consequences if Realized:**
- 2-4 week delay for CAB meeting schedule and review cycle
- Sep 2025 migration deadline at risk if CAB deferred for additional information
- Security gates not passed ‚Üí Beta phase blocked
- Organizational governance failure ‚Üí Audit finding

**Affected Stakeholders:** CIO (SD-5 strategic delivery), CISO (SD-1 governance), IT Ops (SD-3 execution), Project Security Lead

**Inherent Risk:** Likelihood 3 √ó Impact 4 = **12 (Medium)**
**Residual Risk:** Likelihood 3 √ó Impact 3 = **9 (Medium)** after controls

**Risk Appetite:** 6 (Medium tolerance for governance delays)
**Status vs Appetite:** ‚ö†Ô∏è Exceeds appetite by 3 points - Active management required

**Current Controls:**
- Security Impact Assessment template available (organizational standard)

---

### Risk R-003: Timeline Slips Past Windows 10 EOL (October 2025) ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL

**Category:** STRATEGIC | **Status:** In Progress | **Owner:** IT Operations Director

**Risk Description:**
Migration timeline slips past Windows 10 EOL (Oct 14, 2025) due to organizational security preparation delays (2-month CAB process), hardware supply chain delays, vendor capacity constraints, or application compatibility blockers. Sep 2025 target has 6-week buffer.

**Root Cause (CORRECTED v3.0):** Timeline requires 2-month organizational security preparation (Security Impact Assessment, CAB approval, threat model, Security Architecture Review). Original v2.0 incorrectly assumed 3-month MOD CAAT process.

**Consequences if Realized:**
- Windows 10 devices unsupported post-EOL ‚Üí Critical security vulnerability
- Cyber insurance invalidated ‚Üí ¬£500K-¬£2M breach exposure uninsured
- Compliance audit findings ‚Üí ISO 27001 recertification at risk
- Extended Security Updates (ESU) cost ‚Üí ¬£50-¬£200 per device per year

**Affected Stakeholders:** CISO (SD-1 EOL risk), CIO (SD-5 strategic failure), IT Ops (SD-3 execution failure), CFO (SD-2 ESU costs)

**Inherent Risk:** Likelihood 5 √ó Impact 4 = **20 (Critical)**
**Residual Risk:** Likelihood 3 √ó Impact 4 = **12 (Medium)** after controls

**Risk Appetite:** 12 (High tolerance for controlled timeline variance with ESU fallback)
**Status vs Appetite:** ‚úÖ Within appetite

**Current Controls:**
- 6-week timeline buffer (Sep 1 target vs Oct 14 EOL)
- Phased rollout with pause criteria
- Early hardware procurement
- **v3.0 CORRECTION**: Security prep timeline reduced from 3 months ‚Üí 2 months (CAAT overhead removed)

**Mitigation Actions:**
1. Parallel security activities (Security Impact Assessment + threat model concurrent) (¬£15K, Month 1) ‚Üí Likelihood 3‚Üí2
2. Pre-authorize ¬£200K ESU contingency (CFO, Sep 2025) ‚Üí Impact 4‚Üí3
3. Increase wave throughput 500‚Üí750 devices/week (IT Ops, Month 4) ‚Üí Likelihood 2‚Üí1
**Target: 6 (Within appetite 12)**

**Success Criteria:** Migration complete by Sep 1, 2025 (6 weeks before Windows 10 EOL)

**Monitoring:** Weekly Steering Committee review, monthly Board updates

---

### Risk R-004: Security Impact Assessment Not Completed (NEW - Replaces v2.0 R-004 CAAT BIA) ‚ö†Ô∏è MEDIUM

**Category:** COMPLIANCE | **Status:** Open | **Owner:** Project Security Lead

**Risk Description:**
Security Impact Assessment not completed using organizational template before CAB submission. Assessment required to document threat landscape, security controls, data flows, compliance requirements, and risk mitigation for change to existing accredited system.

**Root Cause:** Security Impact Assessment template requires input from multiple stakeholders (CISO, Data Protection Officer, App Owners) and technical analysis (threat model, Architecture Review).

**Consequences if Realized:**
- CAB approval delayed (R-001) ‚Üí 2-4 week delay
- Security gaps not identified early ‚Üí Remediation costs increase
- Organizational governance requirements not met ‚Üí Audit finding
- Architecture Review cannot proceed without baseline assessment

**Affected Stakeholders:** Project Security Lead (assessment owner), CISO (governance), CAB (approval gate), IT Ops (timeline)

**Inherent Risk:** Likelihood 4 √ó Impact 3 = **12 (Medium)**
**Residual Risk:** Likelihood 3 √ó Impact 3 = **9 (Medium)** after controls

**Risk Appetite:** 6 (Low tolerance for security governance gaps)
**Status vs Appetite:** ‚ö†Ô∏è Exceeds appetite by 3 points - Active management required

**Current Controls:**
- Organizational Security Impact Assessment template available
- Project Security Lead appointment (Week 1)
- Threat modeling guidance available (STRIDE methodology)

**Mitigation Actions:**
1. Appoint Project Security Lead with security assessment experience (CIO, Week 1, ¬£0) ‚Üí Likelihood 4‚Üí3
2. Complete Security Impact Assessment (Project Security Lead, Week 2, ¬£5K consultant support) ‚Üí Likelihood 3‚Üí2, Impact 3‚Üí2
3. CISO review and approval (Week 3, ¬£0) ‚Üí **Target: 4 (Within appetite)**

**Success Criteria:** Security Impact Assessment 100% complete, CISO approved, submitted to CAB by Week 3

**Monitoring:** Weekly Project Security Lead updates to IT Ops Director

---

### Risk R-005: No Threat Model Documented ‚ö†Ô∏è HIGH

**Category:** COMPLIANCE | **Status:** Open | **Owner:** Project Security Lead (CHANGED from DTSL in v2.0)

**Risk Description:**
Formal threat model using STRIDE methodology not documented. Threat model required by organizational security governance to identify attack vectors, threat actors, vulnerabilities, and mitigations for Security Impact Assessment and Architecture Review.

**Root Cause:** Threat modeling expertise required (STRIDE: Spoofing, Tampering, Repudiation, Information Disclosure, Denial of Service, Elevation of Privilege). Zero Trust Architecture (Conditional Access, MFA, encryption) creates complex threat landscape.

**Consequences if Realized:**
- Security Impact Assessment incomplete (R-004) ‚Üí CAB approval blocked (R-001)
- Security Architecture Review cannot validate controls without threat baseline
- Unidentified attack vectors discovered post-deployment ‚Üí Remediation costs ¬£50K-¬£200K
- Organizational security governance failure ‚Üí Audit finding

**Affected Stakeholders:** Project Security Lead (owner), CISO (security governance), IT Ops (timeline), CAB (approval gate)

**Inherent Risk:** Likelihood 3 √ó Impact 5 = **15 (High)**
**Residual Risk:** Likelihood 3 √ó Impact 4 = **12 (Medium)** after controls

**Risk Appetite:** 6 (Low tolerance for threat modeling gaps)
**Status vs Appetite:** ‚ö†Ô∏è Exceeds appetite by 6 points (100%) - Active mitigation required

**Current Controls:**
- Requirements v5.0 NFR-SEC-004 mandates threat model before Beta
- STRIDE methodology guidance available
- Zero Trust Architecture design documented (Conditional Access, MFA, BitLocker, Defender)

**Mitigation Actions:**
1. Project Security Lead complete STRIDE threat model with CISO support (Month 1, ¬£15K) ‚Üí Likelihood 3‚Üí2, Impact 4‚Üí2
2. Architecture Review validates threat model completeness (Month 2, ¬£0) ‚Üí **Target: 4 (Within appetite)**

**Success Criteria:** STRIDE threat model 100% complete, CISO approved, all attack vectors documented with mitigations

**Monitoring:** Bi-weekly Project Security Lead updates until complete

---

### Risk R-007: Vendor Selection - Security Governance Experience Gap ‚ö†Ô∏è HIGH

**Category:** OPERATIONAL | **Status:** Open | **Owner:** Procurement

**Risk Description (CORRECTED v3.0):**
Vendor selected lacks organizational security governance experience (ISO 27001, NIST CSF, NCSC Secure Design, CAB processes, Security Impact Assessments). Vendor must demonstrate experience with organizational change control and security review processes for existing accredited systems.

**Root Cause:** v2.0 incorrectly focused on MOD CAAT expertise (not required). v3.0 corrects criteria to organizational security governance.

**Consequences if Realized:**
- Vendor cannot coordinate CAB approval process ‚Üí R-001 worsens
- Security Impact Assessment incomplete or non-compliant ‚Üí CAB rejection
- Organizational security governance requirements not met ‚Üí Audit finding
- Re-procurement if vendor fundamentally unable to deliver ‚Üí ¬£250K-¬£500K + 8-12 week delay

**Affected Stakeholders:** Procurement (vendor selection), CISO (governance compliance), IT Ops (timeline), CFO (re-procurement costs)

**Inherent Risk:** Likelihood 4 √ó Impact 4 = **16 (High)**
**Residual Risk:** Likelihood 3 √ó Impact 4 = **12 (Medium)** after controls

**Risk Appetite:** 8 (Medium-high tolerance for vendor capability gaps if remediable)
**Status vs Appetite:** ‚ö†Ô∏è Exceeds appetite by 4 points (50%) - Active mitigation required

**Current Controls:**
- Evaluation Criteria v2.0 updated to assess organizational security governance experience (not CAAT)
- Mandatory qualification: Vendor must demonstrate 2+ projects with ISO 27001, CAB processes, Security Impact Assessments
- Scoring criteria: ISO 27001 (2 points), NIST CSF (2 points), NCSC (2 points), InTune Zero Trust (2 points) = 8 points total

**Mitigation Actions:**
1. Update RFP/SOW to clearly state organizational security governance requirements (not MOD CAAT) (Procurement, Week 1, ¬£0) ‚Üí Impact 4‚Üí3
2. Enforce mandatory qualification during vendor evaluation (Procurement, Month 2, ¬£0) ‚Üí Likelihood 3‚Üí2
3. Require vendor to provide Project Security Lead CV and security governance case studies (Month 2, ¬£0) ‚Üí **Target: 6 (Within appetite)**

**Success Criteria:** Selected vendor scores 6+/8 on organizational security governance criteria, has demonstrated CAB experience on 2+ projects

**Monitoring:** Procurement weekly updates during RFP evaluation phase
