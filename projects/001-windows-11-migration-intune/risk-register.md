## Executive Summary

### Risk Profile Overview

**Total Risks Identified:** 22 risks across 6 categories

**CRITICAL UPDATE (v2.0)**: MOD Secure by Design Assessment v2.0 identified 7 critical governance gaps related to the shift from RMADS (deprecated) to CAAT continuous assurance framework. These gaps create significant COMPLIANCE and STRATEGIC risks that must be addressed before Beta phase.

| Risk Level | Inherent | Residual | Change |
|------------|----------|----------|--------|
| **Critical** (20-25) | 8 | 3 | ‚Üì 63% |
| **High** (13-19) | 9 | 7 | ‚Üì 22% |
| **Medium** (6-12) | 4 | 9 | ‚Üë 125% |
| **Low** (1-5) | 1 | 3 | ‚Üë 200% |
| **TOTAL** | 291 | 193 | ‚Üì 34% |

**Overall Residual Risk Score:** 193/550 (35% of maximum)
**Risk Reduction from Controls:** 34% reduction from inherent risk
**Risk Profile Status:** ‚ö†Ô∏è **CONCERNING** - 3 Critical risks and 7 High risks require immediate action

### Risk Category Distribution

| Category | Count | Avg Inherent | Avg Residual | Control Effectiveness |
|----------|-------|--------------|--------------|----------------------|
| **STRATEGIC** | 3 | 16.7 | 10.7 | 36% reduction |

| **REPUTATIONAL** | 1 | 15.0 | 9.0 | 40% reduction |
| **TECHNOLOGY** | 2 | 13.5 | 9.0 | 33% reduction |

### Top 10 Critical Risks Requiring Immediate Attention

1. **R-001** (COMPLIANCE, Critical 20): MOD CAAT Registration Not Completed - Owner: CIO - Status: Open
2. **R-002** (COMPLIANCE, Critical 20): No DTSL Appointed (Three Lines of Defence Gap) - Owner: CISO - Status: Open
3. **R-003** (STRATEGIC, Critical 20): Timeline Slips Past Windows 10 EOL - Owner: IT Ops Director - Status: In Progress
4. **R-004** (COMPLIANCE, High 16): No Business Impact Assessment for CAAT - Owner: DTSL (TBD) - Status: Open
5. **R-005** (COMPLIANCE, High 16): No Threat Model Documented - Owner: DTSL (TBD) - Status: Open
6. **R-006** (COMPLIANCE, High 16): No Supplier Attestation per ISN 2023/10 - Owner: Procurement - Status: Open
7. **R-007** (OPERATIONAL, High 15): Vendor Selection - RMADS-Only Experience Insufficient - Owner: Procurement - Status: Open
8. **R-008** (OPERATIONAL, High 15): Support Ticket Volume Overwhelms Helpdesk - Owner: Helpdesk Manager - Status: In Progress
9. **R-009** (FINANCIAL, High 15): Budget Overruns Eliminate ROI - Owner: CFO - Status: In Progress
10. **R-010** (TECHNOLOGY, High 15): Cloud Data Sovereignty Unclear - Owner: CISO - Status: Open

### Key Findings

**‚ùå CRITICAL MOD Security Governance Gaps (7 risks added in v2.0):**
- CAAT not registered (mandatory for all MOD programmes per JSP 440 Leaflet 5C)
- No DTSL appointed (First Line of Defence role missing)
- No BIA completed (required for CAAT self-assessment)
- No threat model documented (STRIDE/DREAD methodology)
- No supplier attestations obtained (ISN 2023/10 continuous attestation requirement)
- No PSyO appointed (for OFFICIAL-SENSITIVE data)
- No Second Line Security Governance Review scheduled

**‚ö†Ô∏è VENDOR SELECTION COMPLEXITY:**
- Evaluation Criteria v2.0 MQ-11 requires CAAT expertise (not RMADS)
- Vendors with only RMADS experience will score 2/8 or 0/8 on Subcriterion 1.3
- Risk of selecting non-compliant vendor if MQ-11 not enforced

**üìä RISK CONCENTRATION:**
- CISO owns 43% of total residual risk (83/193 points) - Resource overload
- 5 of 7 COMPLIANCE risks exceed appetite by average 8.4 points (84%)
- 3-month MOD security preparation timeline added to critical path

### Recommendations

1. **IMMEDIATE (Week 1)**: Register on CAAT and appoint DTSL - Blockers for all other MOD activities
2. **URGENT (Week 2)**: Complete BIA and initiate threat modeling
3. **HIGH PRIORITY (Month 1)**: Obtain supplier attestations per ISN 2023/10
4. **CRITICAL (Vendor Selection)**: Enforce MQ-11 mandatory qualification - Disqualify vendors without CAAT expertise
5. **ESCALATION**: Brief CIO/Board on 3-month delay risk if MOD security prep not accelerated

## C. Detailed Risk Profiles

### Risk R-001: MOD CAAT Registration Not Completed ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL

**Category:** COMPLIANCE | **Status:** Open | **Owner:** CIO

**Risk Description:**
Programme not registered on CAAT (Cyber Activity and Assurance Tracker), mandatory for all MOD programmes per JSP 440 Leaflet 5C. Without CAAT registration, cannot complete security self-assessment, proceed to Beta, or demonstrate MOD Secure by Design compliance.

**Root Cause:** Post-August 2023 MOD framework shift from RMADS to CAAT not reflected in initial project planning.

**Consequences if Realized:**
- 3-6 month project delay for CAAT registration + BIA + threat model + self-assessment
- Vendor contract awarded to non-compliant vendor (RMADS expertise vs CAAT) ‚Üí ¬£500K-¬£1M re-procurement
- MOD audit finding ‚Üí Project stop notice
- Sep 2025 migration deadline missed ‚Üí Windows 10 EOL non-compliance

**Affected Stakeholders:** CIO (SD-5 strategic modernization), CISO (SD-1 compliance), IT Ops (SD-3 execution), CFO (SD-2 budget)

**Inherent Risk:** Likelihood 5 √ó Impact 5 = **25 (Critical)**
**Residual Risk:** Likelihood 4 √ó Impact 4 = **16 (High)** after controls

**Current Controls:**
- MOD SbD Assessment v2.0 identified gap early (mod-secure-by-design.md:47-50)
- Requirements v4.0 updated with CAAT framework (NFR-SEC-004)
- Evaluation Criteria v2.0 MQ-11 requires vendor CAAT expertise

**Mitigation Actions:**
1. Register on CAAT (CIO, Week 1, ¬£0) ‚Üí Reduces to 8
2. Appoint DTSL (CIO, Week 1, ¬£0) ‚Üí Enables BIA/self-assessment
3. Complete BIA (DTSL, Week 2, ¬£5K) ‚Üí Reduces to 4
4. Complete CAAT self-assessment (DTSL, Month 1, ¬£10K) ‚Üí **Target: 4**

**Success Criteria:** CAAT reference number obtained, BIA 100% complete, 7 SbD Principles self-assessment complete

**Monitoring:** Weekly Steering Committee review until target achieved

---

### Risk R-002: No DTSL Appointed - Three Lines of Defence Gap ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL

**Category:** COMPLIANCE | **Status:** Open | **Owner:** CISO

**Risk Description:**
No Delivery Team Security Lead (DTSL) appointed as required by JSP 440 Leaflet 5C. DTSL is First Line of Defence role responsible for security ownership, CAAT self-assessments, and day-to-day security management. Without DTSL, project lacks security governance and violates Three Lines of Defence model.

**Root Cause:** Legacy RMADS used IAO/IAA roles instead of DTSL (First Line) and Second Line Security Governance Reviews.

**Consequences if Realized:**
- Cannot complete CAAT registration (blocks R-001 mitigation)
- No security ownership ‚Üí Security gaps not identified
- Vendor cannot coordinate MOD security activities
- Three Lines of Defence governance failure ‚Üí MOD audit finding

**Affected Stakeholders:** CISO (SD-1 security governance), CIO (SD-5 MOD compliance), IT Ops (SD-3 security coordination)

**Inherent Risk:** Likelihood 5 √ó Impact 4 = **20 (Critical)**
**Residual Risk:** Likelihood 4 √ó Impact 4 = **16 (High)**

**Mitigation Actions:**
1. Appoint DTSL (CIO, Week 1, ¬£0) ‚Üí Reduces likelihood 4‚Üí1, impact 4‚Üí2
2. DTSL complete BIA (Week 2, ¬£5K)
3. DTSL complete CAAT self-assessment (Month 1, ¬£10K)
**Target: 2 (Within appetite)**

---

### Risk R-003: Timeline Slips Past Windows 10 EOL (October 2025) ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL

**Category:** STRATEGIC | **Status:** In Progress | **Owner:** IT Operations Director

**Risk Description:**
Migration timeline slips past Windows 10 EOL (Oct 14, 2025) due to MOD security preparation delays (3-month CAAT process), hardware supply chain delays, vendor capacity constraints, or application compatibility blockers. Sep 2025 target has 6-week buffer, but new MOD requirements consume 3 months, reducing buffer to near-zero.

**Root Cause:** Original timeline did not account for 3-month MOD security preparation (CAAT registration, BIA, threat model, self-assessment, supplier attestation).

**Consequences if Realized:**
- Windows 10 devices unsupported post-EOL ‚Üí Critical security vulnerability
- Cyber insurance invalidated ‚Üí ¬£500K-¬£2M breach exposure uninsured
- Compliance audit findings ‚Üí ISO 27001 recertification at risk
- Extended Security Updates (ESU) cost ‚Üí ¬£50-¬£200 per device per year

**Affected Stakeholders:** CISO (SD-1 EOL risk), CIO (SD-5 strategic failure), IT Ops (SD-3 execution failure), CFO (SD-2 ESU costs)

**Inherent Risk:** Likelihood 5 √ó Impact 4 = **20 (Critical)**
**Residual Risk:** Likelihood 3 √ó Impact 4 = **12 (Medium)** after controls

**Current Controls:**
- 6-week timeline buffer (Sep 1 target vs Oct 14 EOL)
- Phased rollout with pause criteria
- Early hardware procurement

**Mitigation Actions:**
1. Accelerate MOD security prep (parallel activities) (¬£20K, Month 1) ‚Üí Likelihood 3‚Üí2
2. Pre-authorize ¬£200K ESU contingency (CFO, Sep 2025) ‚Üí Impact 4‚Üí3
3. Increase wave throughput weekly vs bi-weekly (IT Ops, Month 4) ‚Üí Likelihood 2‚Üí1
**Target: 6 (Within appetite 12)**
