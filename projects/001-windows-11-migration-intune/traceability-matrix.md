## 1. Executive Summary

### 1.1 Traceability Status

**Overall Traceability Score**: 35/100 ÔøΩ **CRITICAL GAPS**

**Current Phase**: Requirements Complete, Design Phase Not Started

**Key Findings**:
- ‚úÖ **45 requirements documented** (8 BR, 20 FR, 14 NFR, 3 INT) with clear acceptance criteria
- L **High-Level Design (HLD) does not exist** - BLOCKING for traceability
- L **Detailed Design (DLD) does not exist** - BLOCKING for traceability
- L **No test cases defined** - Cannot verify test coverage
- L **0% design coverage** - Requirements not yet mapped to design components
- L **0% test coverage** - No tests defined or executed

**Recommendation**: **DESIGN PHASE REQUIRED** - Cannot proceed to implementation without HLD/DLD documenting how requirements will be implemented.
