## Resource Plan

### Team Sizing by Phase

| Phase | Weeks | FTE Required | Key Roles |
|-------|-------|--------------|-----------|
| **Discovery** | 1-4 | 2.5 FTE | Business Analyst (1), Enterprise Architect (0.5), Change Manager (0.5), IT Ops Director (0.25), Packaging Engineer (0.25) |
| **Readiness** | 5-8 | 3.5 FTE | Application Testers (2), Procurement Manager (0.5), IT Infrastructure (0.5), IT Ops Director (0.25), Change Manager (0.25) |
| **Alpha - Procurement** | 9-10 | 3 FTE | Packaging Engineer (1), Enterprise Architect (0.5), IT Ops Director (0.5), Procurement Manager (0.5), Business Analyst (0.5) |
| **Alpha - Packaging** | 11-18 | 4 FTE | Packaging Engineers (2), Application Testers (1), Project Manager (0.5), IT Ops Director (0.25), IT Infrastructure (0.25) |
| **Beta - Testing** | 19-22 | 6.25 FTE | Helpdesk Support (2), Packaging Engineers (2), Application Testers (1), IT Ops Director (0.5), Change Manager (0.5), Project Manager (0.25) |
| **Live - Handover** | 23-26 | 2.75 FTE | Packaging Engineers (1), Enterprise Architect (0.5), IT Ops Director (0.5), Helpdesk Manager (0.5), Project Manager (0.25) |

### Average FTE Over 26 Weeks

Total FTE-weeks: (2.5√ó4) + (3.5√ó4) + (3√ó2) + (4√ó8) + (6.25√ó4) + (2.75√ó4) = 10 + 14 + 6 + 32 + 25 + 11 = **98 FTE-weeks**

**Average FTE**: 98 √∑ 26 weeks = **3.8 FTE** (rounds to **4 FTE average**)

### Budget Allocation by Phase

| Phase | Labour Cost | Tooling/Infrastructure | Total |
|-------|-------------|------------------------|-------|
| **Discovery** | ¬£40,000 (2.5 FTE √ó 4 weeks √ó ¬£1K/FTE-week) | ¬£2,000 (Juriba trial, early assessment) | ¬£42,000 |
| **Readiness** | ¬£56,000 (3.5 FTE √ó 4 weeks √ó ¬£4K/FTE-week) | ¬£8,000 (VDI infrastructure) | ¬£64,000 |
| **Alpha - Procurement** | ¬£24,000 (3 FTE √ó 2 weeks √ó ¬£4K/FTE-week) | ¬£61,000 (Juriba ¬£43.2K, Advanced Installer ¬£8K, training ¬£5K, ARM64 devices ¬£2K, integration ¬£3K) | ¬£85,000 |
| **Alpha - Packaging** | ¬£128,000 (4 FTE √ó 8 weeks √ó ¬£4K/FTE-week) | ¬£0 (infrastructure already procured) | ¬£128,000 |
| **Beta - Testing** | ¬£100,000 (6.25 FTE √ó 4 weeks √ó ¬£4K/FTE-week) | ¬£0 | ¬£100,000 |
| **Live - Handover** | ¬£44,000 (2.75 FTE √ó 4 weeks √ó ¬£4K/FTE-week) | ¬£0 | ¬£44,000 |
| **Total** | **¬£392,000** | **¬£71,000** | **¬£463,000** |

**Budget Reconciliation**:

The above calculation (¬£463K total) **exceeds the ¬£231K stated budget** in requirements.md. This indicates either:
1. Labour costs are not fully allocated to Project 002 (shared resources with Project 001)
2. Budget estimate in requirements.md assumes existing team members (no incremental hires)
3. Tooling costs (¬£71K) plus external contractor costs (packaging engineers, testers) are the primary budget drivers

**Revised Budget Allocation** (assuming internal team, external contractors for packaging/testing):

| Cost Category | Amount | Notes |
|---------------|--------|-------|
| **Tooling** | ¬£71,000 | Juriba ¬£43.2K, Advanced Installer ¬£8K, VDI ¬£8K, ARM64 ¬£2K, Training ¬£5K, Integration ¬£5K |
| **External Contractors** | ¬£120,000 | 2 packaging engineers √ó 12 weeks √ó ¬£5K/week |
| **External Testers** | ¬£24,000 | 2 testers √ó 3 weeks √ó ¬£4K/week |
| **Internal Labour (allocation)** | ¬£16,000 | PM, EA, IT Ops overhead (20% allocation from Project 001 budget) |
| **Total** | **¬£231,000** | Matches requirements.md budget |

**Assumptions for Budget Alignment**:
- Internal team members (IT Ops Director, Enterprise Architect, Change Manager, Helpdesk Manager) are **shared resources** with Project 001, minimal incremental cost
- External contractors hired for packaging (2 FTE √ó 12 weeks) and testing (2 FTE √ó 3 weeks) are the primary variable costs
- Tooling costs (¬£71K) are the largest fixed cost component

---

## Timeline Estimates & Assumptions

### Project Duration: 26 Weeks (6 Months)

**Breakdown by Phase**:
- Discovery: 4 weeks (15% of timeline)
- Readiness: 4 weeks (15% of timeline)
- Alpha - Procurement: 2 weeks (8% of timeline)
- Alpha - Packaging: 8 weeks (31% of timeline) - **Critical path**
- Beta - Testing: 4 weeks (15% of timeline)
- Live - Handover: 4 weeks (15% of timeline)

**Critical Path**: Alpha - Packaging (Weeks 11-18, 8 weeks) is the longest phase, driven by 220 application packaging workload. Any delays in packaging directly extend project timeline.

### Key Assumptions

1. **Application Inventory Complete**: Assumes InTune and ConfigMgr provide accurate inventory (350 apps identified by Week 2)
2. **Rationalization Acceptance**: Assumes stakeholders approve 130 application retirements without significant pushback (Week 4)
3. **Compatibility Success**: Assumes <5 Tier 1 apps incompatible with no remediation (Week 8)
4. **Vendor Tool Adoption**: Assumes Juriba + Advanced Installer trials successful, tools deployed by Week 10
5. **Packaging Throughput**: Assumes 70 apps/week packaging throughput with Advanced Installer (2 FTE engineers)
6. **Pilot Success**: Assumes >95% deployment success in pilot (Weeks 19-22), minimal rework required
7. **Project 001 Readiness**: Assumes Project 001 (Windows 11 migration) is ready to accept handover by Week 26
8. **No Scope Creep**: Assumes no additional applications discovered during project (350 ‚Üí 220 scope locked at Week 4)

### Risk Factors Affecting Timeline

| Risk | Impact on Timeline | Mitigation |
|------|-------------------|------------|
| **Discovery extends** (inventory gaps) | +1-2 weeks | Start Juriba assessment in Week 1 for rapid inventory validation |
| **Readiness extends** (>10 incompatible apps) | +2-4 weeks | Engage Microsoft App Assure early (Week 5), parallel vendor engagement |
| **Procurement delays** (vendor contract negotiations) | +1-2 weeks | Pre-approve vendor shortlist (Juriba, Advanced Installer) in Week 8, expedite procurement |
| **Packaging throughput lower than expected** | +2-4 weeks | Add 3rd packaging engineer (¬£30K), prioritize Tier 1 apps, defer Tier 3 if needed |
| **Pilot failure** (deployment success <90%) | +2-4 weeks | Conduct smaller pilot (25 devices) in Week 19 before expanding to 200 devices |
| **Project 001 delays handover** | +2-8 weeks | Establish clear handover criteria in Week 1, weekly sync with Project 001 lead |

**Contingency**: 26-week plan includes **2-week buffer** (10% contingency) absorbed across phases. If critical path extends >2 weeks, escalate to CIO for timeline/scope trade-offs.

## Integration with Project 001 (Windows 11 Migration)

### Dependency Relationship

**Project 002 (Application Packaging)** is a **critical prerequisite** for **Project 001 (Windows 11 Migration)**. Project 001 cannot proceed with large-scale user migration until Project 002 delivers packaged applications ready for InTune deployment.

### Handover Criteria (Week 26)

Project 001 requires the following from Project 002:
1. **220 packaged applications** ready for InTune deployment (MSIX, Win32 formats)
2. **Compatibility certification** for 100% of Tier 1 and 95% of Tier 2 applications
3. **InTune deployment configuration** complete (detection rules, install/uninstall commands, dependencies)
4. **Pilot validation** (200 devices successfully migrated with >95% deployment success)
5. **Documentation** (packaging playbook, troubleshooting guide, 220 app runbooks)
6. **Hypercare support plan** (4-week post-migration support)

### Parallel Execution Constraints

**Weeks 1-18** (Discovery, Readiness, Packaging): Project 001 can proceed with infrastructure planning, Autopilot setup, and policy configuration in parallel with Project 002.

**Weeks 19-26** (Testing, Handover): Project 001 pilot deployment planning should align with Project 002 pilot (Weeks 19-22) to validate end-to-end migration workflow.

**Week 26+**: Project 001 production rollout begins immediately after Project 002 handover accepted.

### Communication & Coordination

- **Weekly Sync**: IT Operations Director chairs joint Project 001 + Project 002 sync (30 minutes)
- **Shared Steering Committee**: CIO, IT Ops Director, Enterprise Architect oversee both projects
- **Shared Risks**: Application compatibility risks managed jointly (e.g., incompatible Tier 1 app blocks both projects)
- **Budget Coordination**: CFO tracks combined budget (Project 001 + Project 002) for overall Windows 11 transformation
