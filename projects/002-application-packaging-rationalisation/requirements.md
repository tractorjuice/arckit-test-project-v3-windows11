## Executive Summary

### Business Context

As part of the Windows 10 to Windows 11 migration (Project 001), the organization must comprehensively assess, rationalize, and repackage its application portfolio to ensure compatibility with Windows 11 and Microsoft InTune cloud-native management. The current application estate consists of approximately 350+ applications deployed via Configuration Manager, many of which are outdated, redundant, or incompatible with Windows 11 and modern deployment methods.

This Application Packaging and Rationalisation project aims to:
- Inventory and categorize all applications across the 6,000-device estate
- Identify redundant, obsolete, or unused applications for retirement
- Assess Windows 11 compatibility for business-critical applications
- Modernize application packaging for InTune Win32 deployment (MSIX, App-V, .intunewin)
- Reduce application portfolio complexity by 30-40%
- Ensure zero application compatibility blockers before user migration

Without this work, the Windows 11 migration faces critical risks: user productivity disruption from incompatible applications, failed migrations requiring rollback, and helpdesk ticket surges exceeding capacity. This project is a prerequisite dependency for Project 001 migration success.

### Objectives

- **Rationalize Application Portfolio**: Reduce application count by 30-40% through retirement of redundant, obsolete, and unused applications
- **Achieve Windows 11 Compatibility**: Ensure 100% of business-critical applications (Tier 1) are tested and certified for Windows 11 before migration
- **Modernize Application Packaging**: Repackage 100% of retained applications for InTune deployment using MSIX, App-V, or Win32 (.intunewin) formats
- **Enable Cloud-Native Deployment**: Eliminate Configuration Manager dependencies for application deployment, supporting 18-month ConfigMgr decommissioning timeline
- **Reduce Support Burden**: Minimize application-related support tickets to <10% of total migration tickets through proactive compatibility testing

### Expected Outcomes

- **Portfolio Reduction**: Reduce application count from ~350 to <220 applications (30-40% reduction), eliminating licensing costs for retired apps (estimated £200K+ annual savings)
- **Zero Application Blockers**: 100% of business-critical applications tested and certified for Windows 11 before pilot phase of Project 001 (Month 2)
- **Deployment Modernization**: 100% of retained applications packaged for InTune deployment by Month 4, enabling cloud-native management
- **User Satisfaction**: <5% of migration support tickets related to application compatibility issues (vs. 15-25% industry baseline for unprepared migrations)
- **Cost Avoidance**: Avoid £500K-£1M in migration failures, rollbacks, and lost productivity through proactive application readiness

### Project Scope

**In Scope**:
- Application discovery and inventory across all 6,000 Windows 10 devices via InTune, Configuration Manager, and endpoint scanning
- Application rationalization: identify redundant, obsolete, technically incompatible, and unused applications
- Windows 11 compatibility assessment for all business-critical (Tier 1) and standard (Tier 2) applications
- Vendor engagement for Windows 11 compatibility statements and updated application versions
- Application repackaging for InTune deployment: MSIX, App-V, Win32 (.intunewin), Microsoft Store for Business
- InTune Win32 app deployment configuration: detection rules, install/uninstall commands, dependencies, requirements
- Application testing: functional testing in Windows 11 VDI, pilot testing on physical devices
- Application catalog documentation: ownership, compatibility status, deployment method, licensing
- User communication: application changes, retirements, alternatives

**Out of Scope**:
- Application development or custom software engineering (vendor responsibility)
- Line-of-business (LOB) application modernization (separate initiative)
- Azure Virtual Desktop (AVD) application hosting (future consideration)
- Application performance tuning (post-migration optimization)
- Third-party application management platforms (committed to InTune)

## Business Requirements

### BR-001: Application Portfolio Rationalization

**Description**: The organization must reduce application portfolio complexity by retiring redundant, obsolete, and unused applications to minimize migration scope, reduce licensing costs, and simplify ongoing management.

**Rationale**: Current ~350 application portfolio contains significant bloat:
- Multiple applications serving same function (3 PDF editors, 4 screen capture tools, 2 VPN clients)
- Obsolete applications no longer used (legacy versions retained "just in case")
- Vendor-unsupported applications posing security risk
- Applications with <5% user adoption consuming licensing and management overhead

Rationalization directly supports CFO's cost reduction driver (SD-2) from Project 001 stakeholder analysis.

**Success Criteria**:
- Reduce total application count from ~350 to <220 applications (30-40% reduction)
- Identify and retire applications with <5% user adoption (unless business-critical)
- Eliminate redundant applications where single solution can serve multiple use cases
- Quantify annual cost savings from retired application licenses (target: £200K+)

**Priority**: MUST_HAVE

**Stakeholder**: IT Operations Director, CFO, Enterprise Architect

**Maps to Project 001 Goals**:
- G-2 (CFO cost reduction)
- G-1 (IT Ops migration success - reduced scope)
- G-12 (Enterprise Architect governance excellence)

---

### BR-002: Windows 11 Compatibility Certification

**Description**: All business-critical applications (Tier 1) and standard applications (Tier 2) must be tested and certified for Windows 11 compatibility before user migration begins.

**Rationale**: Application incompatibility is the primary cause of migration failures (Architecture Principle 5: Application Compatibility and Testing). Previous Windows 7 to 10 migration suffered 6-month recovery due to untested application compatibility. CISO (SD-1) and IT Operations (SD-3) drivers require risk-free migration execution.

**Success Criteria**:
- 100% of Tier 1 (business-critical) applications tested and certified by Month 2
- 95% of Tier 2 (standard) applications tested and certified by Month 3
- Zero P1 incidents caused by application compatibility issues during pilot phase
- Documented compatibility status for all applications: Compatible | Compatible with Updates | Incompatible with Remediation Plan | Retire

**Priority**: MUST_HAVE

**Stakeholder**: IT Operations Director, CISO, Application Owners

**Maps to Project 001 Goals**:
- G-1 (95% migration success rate)
- G-4 (<2% support ticket rate)
- G-8 (<5% rollback rate)

---

### BR-003: InTune Application Deployment Readiness

**Description**: All retained applications must be repackaged and configured for deployment via Microsoft InTune (Win32 app management) to eliminate Configuration Manager dependencies and support cloud-native endpoint management.

**Rationale**: Architecture Principle 1 (Cloud-First Endpoint Management) mandates InTune as single source of truth. Configuration Manager to be decommissioned by Month 18 of Project 001. Applications not packaged for InTune block ConfigMgr decommissioning and cost savings (G-2).

**Success Criteria**:
- 100% of retained applications packaged for InTune deployment by Month 4
- All application packages include: detection rules, install/uninstall commands, dependencies, requirements
- Deployment success rate >95% in pilot testing
- Zero applications requiring Configuration Manager for deployment post-migration

**Priority**: MUST_HAVE

**Stakeholder**: IT Operations Director, CIO, Enterprise Architect

**Maps to Project 001 Goals**:
- G-7 (ConfigMgr decommissioned Month 18)
- O-4 (Cloud-native IT capability established)
- G-2 (Cost reduction via infrastructure decommissioning)

---

### BR-004: Application Licensing Optimization

**Description**: Optimize application licensing through retirement of unused applications, vendor consolidation, and transition to subscription licensing where cost-effective.

**Rationale**: CFO driver (SD-2) from Project 001 requires cost reduction. Licensing audit identifies £200K-£400K annual savings opportunity from:
- Retiring 100+ unused applications
- Consolidating redundant tools (e.g., standardize on single PDF editor)
- Renegotiating enterprise agreements based on actual usage data

**Success Criteria**:
- Achieve £200K+ annual licensing cost savings through application retirements
- Reduce number of unique software vendors from ~80 to <60
- Optimize license true-up based on actual usage data (InTune inventory)
- Document license optimization opportunities in application catalog

**Priority**: SHOULD_HAVE

**Stakeholder**: CFO, Procurement Manager, IT Operations Director

---

### BR-005: Migration Timeline Alignment

**Description**: Application packaging and rationalization must be completed before Windows 11 pilot phase (Month 2 of Project 001) to avoid delaying migration timeline and Windows 10 EOL risk.

**Rationale**: Windows 10 EOL is October 2025 (non-negotiable). CISO driver (SD-1) requires migration completion by Sep 2025. Application readiness is critical path dependency.

**Success Criteria**:
- Application inventory and rationalization complete by Month 1
- Tier 1 application compatibility testing complete by Month 2 (before pilot)
- Tier 2 application compatibility testing complete by Month 3 (before early adopters)
- Application repackaging for InTune complete by Month 4 (before production waves)
- Zero application-related delays to Project 001 migration schedule

**Priority**: MUST_HAVE

**Stakeholder**: IT Operations Director, CISO, CIO

---

### BR-006: User Productivity Continuity

**Description**: Application changes (retirements, upgrades, replacements) must not disrupt user productivity. Users must have equivalent or superior functionality post-migration.

**Rationale**: End User driver (SD-4) from Project 001: "Don't break my work." Poor application planning causes user frustration, lost productivity, and resistance to migration.

**Success Criteria**:
- <5% of migration support tickets related to application issues
- User satisfaction >80% for application experience post-migration
- Zero unplanned application retirements (all retirements communicated 30+ days in advance per Architecture Principle 14: Change Management)
- Alternative solutions provided for all retired applications

**Priority**: MUST_HAVE

**Stakeholder**: End Users, Helpdesk Manager, IT Operations Director

---

### BR-007: Application Governance and Catalog

**Description**: Establish authoritative application catalog with ownership, licensing, compatibility status, deployment method, and lifecycle stage to enable ongoing application governance.

**Rationale**: Enterprise Architect driver (SD-7) from Project 001 requires governance excellence (G-12: Zero unapproved exceptions). Current application estate lacks centralized visibility.

**Success Criteria**:
- Centralized application catalog in ServiceNow CMDB or SharePoint with 100% application coverage
- Documented application owner for 100% of applications
- Application lifecycle stage tracked: Active | Deprecated | Sunset | Retired
- Quarterly application governance reviews with Application Owners
- Integration with InTune for automated compliance checking

**Priority**: SHOULD_HAVE

**Stakeholder**: Enterprise Architect, IT Operations Director, Application Owners

---

### BR-008: Security and Compliance Posture

**Description**: All applications must meet security and compliance requirements (patching, vulnerability management, data protection) to maintain Zero Trust security posture.

**Rationale**: Architecture Principle 2 (Zero Trust Security Model) and CISO driver (SD-1) mandate Zero Trust. Windows 11 security benefits undermined by insecure applications.

**Success Criteria**:
- 100% of applications scanned for vulnerabilities (SAST, DAST, dependency scanning)
- Zero applications with unpatched critical vulnerabilities deployed to production
- All applications support Windows 11 security features (Defender Application Control compatibility)
- Application security assessment completed for Tier 1 applications before deployment

**Priority**: MUST_HAVE

**Stakeholder**: CISO, Security Architect, Compliance Officer

## Requirement Conflicts & Resolutions

### Conflict C-1: Speed vs. Quality (Timeline vs. Testing Thoroughness)

**Conflicting Requirements**:
- **BR-005**: Application readiness before Project 001 pilot (Month 2) - SPEED
- **BR-002**: 100% Tier 1 applications thoroughly tested with Application Owner UAT - QUALITY

**Stakeholders**:
- **CISO (SD-1)**: Wants speed - migration by Sep 2025 to avoid unsupported OS
- **IT Operations Director (SD-3)**: Wants quality - thorough testing to avoid migration failures

**Resolution Strategy**: INNOVATE

**Decision**: Hire 2 temporary IT Packagers (contractors) for Month 1-3 to increase capacity from 3 to 5 FTEs, enabling parallel testing. If contractor hiring delayed, fallback to prioritizing Tier 1A (30 mission-critical apps) for full UAT, Tier 1B (50 apps) for smoke testing with pilot-phase UAT.

**Decision Authority**: CIO (Executive Sponsor)

**Impact**:
- **Modified**: BR-002 amended: "100% Tier 1 smoke tested before pilot, full UAT completed during pilot (Month 2-3)"
- **Added**: £30K budget for 2 temp contractors (3 months × £5K/month each)

---

### Conflict C-2: Cost vs. Continuity (Aggressive Rationalization vs. User Satisfaction)

**Conflicting Requirements**:
- **BR-001**: Reduce applications 30-40% (350 → <220) for £200K savings - COST
- **BR-006**: User productivity continuity, no forced retirements causing disruption - CONTINUITY

**Stakeholders**:
- **CFO (SD-2)**: Wants aggressive rationalization for cost reduction
- **End Users (SD-4)**: Want retention of familiar applications, avoid retraining

**Resolution Strategy**: COMPROMISE + PHASE

**Decision**: Phased retirements
- **Phase 1 (Month 1-2)**: Retire 80 apps (23%) - non-controversial (obsolete, <2% adoption, duplicates) - £80K savings
- **Phase 2 (Month 4-6)**: Retire 50 apps (14%) - user-impacting with change management (2-5% adoption, consolidation requiring training) - £120K savings (cumulative £200K)
- **Innovate**: Phase 2 includes alternative solution documentation, training webinars, user opt-in pilot (30-day evaluation)

**Decision Authority**: CIO with CFO and Change Manager consultation

**Impact**:
- **Modified**: BR-001 changed from "Month 4" to phased: "23% reduction Month 2, 37% reduction Month 6"
- **Modified**: BR-004 savings phased: "£80K Month 2, £200K Month 6"
- **Added**: FR-017 (Application Change Communication) prioritized to MUST_HAVE

---

### Conflict C-3: Security vs. Velocity (Vulnerability Scanning Delays)

**Conflicting Requirements**:
- **BR-003**: 100% applications packaged for InTune by Month 4 - VELOCITY
- **NFR-SEC-003**: Zero critical vulnerabilities in production (blocks deployment) - SECURITY

**Stakeholders**:
- **IT Operations Director (SD-3)**: Wants velocity - package quickly to meet migration timeline
- **CISO (SD-1)**: Wants security - comprehensive vulnerability scanning blocks insecure apps

**Resolution Strategy**: INNOVATE

**Decision**: Implement automated vulnerability scanning pipeline integrated with InTune packaging workflow:
1. IT Packager uploads package to staging
2. Automated scan runs within 4 hours
3. Automated decision:
   - **Critical**: Block deployment, alert IT Ops and CISO
   - **High**: Flag for review, deploy to test group only (not production)
   - **Medium/Low**: Risk acceptance auto-approved for Tier 2/3, remediation backlog
4. Risk acceptance workflow for High/Medium vulns (CISO approval required for High)

**Decision Authority**: CISO with IT Operations Director consultation

**Impact**:
- **Added**: NFR-SEC-003 amended: "Zero critical in production. High requires CISO risk acceptance. Medium/Low acceptable with 90-day remediation SLA."
- **Added**: Automated vulnerability scanning pipeline tooling requirement
- **Modified**: BR-003 unchanged (Month 4 deadline maintained)

### Appendix D: ARM64 Compatibility Testing Checklist

For Copilot+ PCs (Snapdragon X Elite/Plus) per Architecture Principle 3A:

**Pre-Testing**:
- [ ] Check vendor website for native ARM64 version (preferred)
- [ ] Identify kernel-mode drivers (VPN, security, hardware drivers) - ARM64-native required

**Testing on Physical Snapdragon Device**:
- [ ] Application installs successfully (x64 or ARM64)
- [ ] Application launches without errors
- [ ] Key features functional (create, edit, save, open, print)
- [ ] Performance acceptable (vs. x64 Windows 11 - <20% degradation acceptable)
- [ ] Uninstall clean (no residual files/registry)

**ARM64 Compatibility Decision**:
- **Native ARM64**: Vendor provides ARM64 installer → Deploy native (best performance)
- **x64 Emulated - Good**: Runs under Prism emulation <20% degradation → Deploy x64 (acceptable)
- **x64 Emulated - Degraded**: Runs under emulation >20% degradation → Flag "Copilot+ PC Not Recommended"
- **Incompatible**: Kernel-mode drivers without ARM64 or application fails → Block Copilot+ PC deployment
