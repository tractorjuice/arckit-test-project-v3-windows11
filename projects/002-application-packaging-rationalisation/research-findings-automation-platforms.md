⚠️ **Lower Market Share**: 13.6% mindshare vs. Nexthink 24.3% (less proven at scale)
⚠️ **Complexity**: Comprehensive features require training and expertise to leverage fully
⚠️ **No Migration Orchestration**: Like Nexthink, does not provide project scheduling or workflow automation (Juriba strengths)

#### Recommendation

**DEFER Lakeside SysTrack to Year 2+** (same rationale as Nexthink). Reasons:

1. **Higher Cost**: £120K-£180K/year exceeds Nexthink (£90K-£150K) with similar overlapping functionality
2. **Overlapping with Juriba**: Application rationalization and readiness capabilities duplicate Juriba DPC
3. **Troubleshooting Overkill**: Advanced Black Box/Resolve features more valuable for ongoing operations (Year 2+) than migration project
4. **Alternative**: Use InTune native reporting + Juriba for Year 1 (£43K), add SysTrack in Year 2 if advanced troubleshooting needed

**When to Consider SysTrack**:
- Organization already uses Lakeside for VDI monitoring (existing relationship)
- Post-migration troubleshooting reveals complex application stability issues requiring forensic analysis
- Budget allows £120K-£180K/year DEM investment for Year 2+ evergreen operations

### 2.3 Liquidware Stratusphere UX (VDI-Focused DEM)

**Vendor**: Liquidware (US-based, established 2009)
**Product**: Stratusphere UX
**Type**: SaaS/On-Premises Digital Experience Monitoring (VDI/DaaS focus)
**Website**: https://www.liquidware.com/

#### Description

Liquidware Stratusphere UX provides digital experience monitoring with a focus on VDI/DaaS environments (Citrix, VMware Horizon, Azure Virtual Desktop). It supports application analysis, inventory, and rationalization during migration planning.

#### Key Features

- **Application Inventory**: Detailed application inventory with version information and consumption metrics
- **Application Analysis**: Installed vs. in-use applications, usage metrics, asset recovery
- **Application Strategy**: Identifies best candidates for application layering (Liquidware FlexApp) by user group
- **VDI Right-Sizing**: Stratusphere right-sizes DaaS desktops based on actual resource usage
- **ServiceNow Integration**: Stratusphere Base Integration Kit for ITSM workflows

#### Pricing

**Pricing not publicly disclosed**. Estimated based on VDI monitoring focus:
- **Estimated**: £15-£25/device/year (similar to Nexthink)
- **6,000 devices**: £90,000 - £150,000/year (estimated)

#### Use Cases

**Best Fit**:
- Organizations using VDI/DaaS (Citrix, VMware, AVD) for application delivery
- Application layering strategy with Liquidware FlexApp
- VDI resource optimization (right-sizing virtual desktops)

**Poor Fit for Project 002**:
- Project 002 uses InTune cloud-native deployment (not VDI/DaaS)
- Physical Windows 11 devices (not virtual desktops)
- No VDI or application layering in scope (out of scope per requirements.md)

#### Recommendation

**Do not adopt Liquidware Stratusphere for Project 002**. Reasons:

1. **VDI Focus**: Stratusphere optimized for VDI/DaaS environments (Citrix, VMware, AVD); Project 002 uses physical devices + InTune
2. **Out of Scope**: VDI and AVD explicitly out of scope per requirements.md §1.5 (Out of Scope: "Azure Virtual Desktop (AVD) application hosting")
3. **Better Alternatives**: Nexthink and SysTrack provide superior physical endpoint monitoring vs. Stratusphere's VDI focus
4. **Cost**: £90K-£150K/year without VDI-specific value for Project 002

**Alternative Use Case**: If organization adopts AVD in Year 2+ for legacy application hosting (e.g., incompatible apps run in cloud VDI), re-evaluate Stratusphere for VDI-specific monitoring.

## 3.0 Build vs. Buy Analysis

### 3.1 Migration Automation Category

#### Build (Manual Project Management)

**When to Build**:
- Budget constraints prevent commercial platform purchase
- Small-scale migration (<1,000 devices, <50 applications)
- Existing project management tools (Jira, Microsoft Project) sufficient
- Strong internal project management expertise

**Approach**:
- **Tools**: Excel spreadsheets, SharePoint lists, Power BI dashboards, Microsoft Project
- **Inventory**: Manual CSV exports from InTune, ConfigMgr, Active Directory
- **Rationalization**: Business analyst manually analyzes usage data, creates retirement recommendations
- **Readiness**: Manual device/application compatibility checks, track in spreadsheets
- **Scheduling**: Project manager manually schedules migration waves, sends email communications
- **Reporting**: Weekly PowerPoint decks for steering committee updates

**Effort Estimate**:
- **Project Manager**: 1 FTE × 18 months = 1.5 person-years (£120K)
- **Business Analyst**: 0.5 FTE × 12 months = 0.5 person-years (£20K)
- **Data Analyst**: 0.25 FTE × 18 months = 0.375 person-years (£15K)
- **Total**: 2.375 person-years

**Cost Estimate** (3-Year TCO):

| Year | PM Labour | BA Labour | Analyst Labour | Tools (Excel/SharePoint) | Annual Total |
|------|-----------|-----------|----------------|--------------------------|--------------|
| Year 1 | £80,000 (1 FTE) | £20,000 (0.5 FTE) | £15,000 (0.25 FTE) | £0 (included in M365) | £115,000 |
| Year 2 | £40,000 (0.5 FTE) | £10,000 (0.25 FTE) | £10,000 (0.17 FTE) | £0 | £60,000 |
| Year 3 | £20,000 (0.25 FTE evergreen) | £5,000 (0.12 FTE) | £5,000 (0.08 FTE) | £0 | £30,000 |
| **3-Year Total** | **£140,000** | **£35,000** | **£30,000** | **£0** | **£205,000** |

**Risks**:
- **Data Quality**: Manual CSV exports prone to errors, outdated data, missing devices
- **Scalability**: Spreadsheets break at scale (6,000 devices × 350 apps = 2.1M data points)
- **Human Error**: Manual scheduling errors cause migration failures, rollbacks
- **Timeline Risk**: Manual processes extend 18-month project to 24-30 months (50% delay)
- **Support Burden**: Lack of automation increases support tickets by 30% (£15K additional cost)
