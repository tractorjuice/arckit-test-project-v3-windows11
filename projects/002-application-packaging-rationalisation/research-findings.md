### 1.2 Win32 (.intunewin) - Wrapped Legacy Installers

**Description**: Win32 apps in InTune use the `.intunewin` format, which wraps traditional EXE, MSI, or script-based installers for cloud deployment via InTune Management Extension (IME). This is the most flexible format for legacy enterprise applications.

#### Key Features

- **Wrapper Format**: Packages existing installers (EXE, MSI, MSIX, PowerShell scripts) into `.intunewin` format
- **Microsoft Win32 Content Prep Tool**: Free command-line utility (`IntuneWinAppUtil.exe`) for creating `.intunewin` packages
- **Detection Rules**: Define custom logic to detect if application is installed (registry, file system, scripts)
- **Dependencies**: Support for application dependencies and supersedence chains
- **Requirements Rules**: Target deployments based on OS version, disk space, CPU architecture
- **30GB Size Limit**: Single `.intunewin` package can be up to 30GB (sufficient for most enterprise apps)

#### Advantages

✅ **Maximum Flexibility**: Supports virtually any installer type (EXE, MSI, BATCH, PowerShell, VBS)
✅ **Legacy Application Support**: Handles complex installers with pre/post-install scripts
✅ **Free Tooling**: Microsoft Win32 Content Prep Tool is free and CLI-scriptable
✅ **Detection Granularity**: Custom detection rules allow precise version management
✅ **Proven Maturity**: Win32 app deployment has been stable in InTune since 2019
✅ **Large File Support**: 30GB limit accommodates engineering software (CAD, design tools)

#### Limitations

⚠️ **Manual Packaging**: Requires manual configuration of install commands, detection rules, return codes
⚠️ **No Self-Service**: Users cannot uninstall Win32 apps without admin rights (unlike MSIX)
⚠️ **Deployment Overhead**: InTune Management Extension (IME) required on endpoints (adds 50-100MB per device)
⚠️ **Update Management**: No differential updates; entire package re-downloaded on version change
⚠️ **Security**: Requires careful validation of install scripts to prevent malicious code injection

#### Use Cases for Project 002

- **Legacy Enterprise Applications**: Line-of-business apps with complex installers (~65% of 220 apps)
- **EXE-based Installers**: Applications without MSI installers (vendor-provided EXE with silent switches)
- **Custom Scripts**: Applications requiring pre-install checks, registry modifications, or post-install configuration
- **Engineering Software**: Large CAD, design, and development tools (AutoCAD, SolidWorks, Visual Studio)
- **Vendor Applications**: Third-party enterprise software without MSIX packages

#### Best Practices (Microsoft Recommendations)

1. **Folder Structure**: Keep Win32 Content Prep Tool separate from installation files to avoid including unnecessary files in `.intunewin` package
2. **Subfolders for Dependencies**: Place referenced files (scripts, config files) in subfolders within source folder
3. **Silent Installers**: Always test silent install commands (e.g., `/S`, `/quiet`, `/qn`) before packaging
4. **Detection Rules**: Use file version detection (most reliable) over registry detection where possible
5. **Return Codes**: Document expected return codes (0 = success, 3010 = reboot required, 1707 = success)
6. **App Icon**: Provide high-resolution icon (minimum 512x512 PNG) for Company Portal visibility

**Recommendation**: Use Win32 (.intunewin) format for 65% of application portfolio (143 apps), focusing on legacy line-of-business applications, complex installers, and vendor software without native MSIX packages.

### 1.3 App-V (Application Virtualization) - Legacy Format

**Description**: Microsoft Application Virtualization (App-V) creates virtualized application packages that run in isolated environments without modifying the underlying OS. Originally designed for Configuration Manager deployments.

#### Key Features

- **Application Virtualization**: Apps run in sandboxed virtual environments (similar to containers)
- **Streaming Deployment**: Applications can be streamed on-demand rather than fully installed
- **Compatibility Layer**: Allows incompatible applications to coexist on same device
- **Configuration Manager Integration**: Tight integration with on-premises SCCM infrastructure

#### Current Status (2024)

⚠️ **End of Life (EOL) Announced**: Microsoft announced App-V end of support in **April 2026**
⚠️ **No New Features**: App-V has not received feature updates since Windows 10 20H2 (2020)
⚠️ **Migration Path**: Microsoft recommends migrating to MSIX (preferred) or Win32 (fallback)
⚠️ **InTune Support**: Limited InTune integration; primarily designed for Configuration Manager

#### Advantages

✅ **Application Isolation**: Prevents conflicts between incompatible applications
✅ **Streaming Capability**: Reduces initial deployment size for large applications
✅ **Configuration Manager Integration**: Seamless integration with existing SCCM infrastructure

#### Limitations

❌ **End of Life 2026**: No future support, security updates, or bug fixes after April 2026
❌ **Cloud-Native Gap**: Not designed for cloud-native InTune deployments (legacy SCCM format)
❌ **Packaging Complexity**: App-V packaging requires specialized skills and virtual machine environments
❌ **Performance Overhead**: Virtualization layer adds 10-15% CPU/memory overhead
❌ **Limited Vendor Support**: Most ISVs have deprecated App-V packages in favor of MSIX

#### Migration Strategy for Project 002

Since Project 002 requires eliminating Configuration Manager dependencies within 18 months (BR-005), all existing App-V packages must be migrated:

1. **Identify App-V Packages**: Use Configuration Manager reporting to list all App-V applications (~5% of portfolio estimated)
2. **Prioritize Migration**:
   - **First Priority**: Migrate to MSIX if application supports containerization
   - **Second Priority**: Repackage as Win32 (.intunewin) for complex installers
   - **Last Resort**: Evaluate if application is still required (may be candidate for retirement)
3. **Timeline**: Complete App-V migration by **Month 6** (before April 2026 EOL)
4. **Testing**: Validate migrated packages on Windows 11 test devices before production deployment

**Recommendation**: **Phase out App-V entirely** during Project 002. Allocate 10% of packaging effort (FR-007) to migrate existing App-V packages (~17 apps) to MSIX or Win32 formats by Month 6. Do not create any new App-V packages.

---

### 1.4 Format Selection Decision Matrix

Use the following decision tree to select the appropriate packaging format for each application:

```
START: Application Assessment
│
├─ Is application available as MSIX from vendor/Microsoft Store?
│  ├─ YES → **Use MSIX** (Vendor-provided)
│  └─ NO → Continue
│
├─ Does application require Windows Services or kernel drivers?
│  ├─ YES → **Use Win32** (MSIX does not support services/drivers)
│  └─ NO → Continue
│
├─ Is application modern (installed via Microsoft Store / winget)?
│  ├─ YES → **Convert to MSIX** (Use MSIX Packaging Tool)
│  └─ NO → Continue
│
├─ Is application Tier 3 (Optional) with self-service requirement?
│  ├─ YES → **Convert to MSIX** (Enables user self-install/uninstall)
│  └─ NO → Continue
│
├─ Does application have complex installer with pre/post-install scripts?
│  ├─ YES → **Use Win32** (Maximum installer flexibility)
│  └─ NO → Continue
│
├─ Is application > 10GB in size or requires admin rights for install?
│  ├─ YES → **Use Win32** (30GB limit, supports elevated installs)
│  └─ NO → Continue
│
├─ Is application currently packaged as App-V?
│  ├─ YES → **Migrate to MSIX/Win32** (App-V EOL April 2026)
│  └─ NO → Continue
│
└─ DEFAULT → **Use Win32** (Safest fallback for legacy applications)
```

**Expected Format Distribution (220 Applications)**:

- **MSIX**: 65 applications (30%) - Modern apps, self-service tools, Microsoft applications
- **Win32**: 143 applications (65%) - Legacy enterprise apps, complex installers, vendor software
- **App-V (Sunset)**: 12 applications (5%) - Migrate to MSIX/Win32 by Month 6

⚠️ **Complexity**: Steep learning curve; 80-120 hours training required for proficiency
⚠️ **Over-Engineered for 220 Apps**: Designed for 500+ application portfolios; overkill for Project 002
⚠️ **Limited MSIX Leadership**: Not first-to-market for MSIX (Advanced Installer led MSIX adoption in 2018)
⚠️ **Multi-License Requirement**: Need 3-4 licenses for 2-user team with redundancy (×4 cost multiplier)

#### Customer Reviews (2024)

**Limited Public Reviews**: Web search did not return dedicated customer review platforms (G2, Capterra, TrustPilot) with 2024 reviews. Vendor claims:

✅ **Market Presence**: 66,000 companies globally use AdminStudio
✅ **2024 R2 Update**: New Alternate Location feature improves package management in complex environments
✅ **Package Feed**: Access to thousands of validated installers from software vendors

**Concerns** (inferred from pricing and licensing changes):
⚠️ **Perpetual License Elimination**: Shift from perpetual to timed subscription (2024) indicates vendor prioritizing recurring revenue over customer ownership
⚠️ **Pricing Opacity**: Vendor does not publish pricing publicly; requires sales engagement for quotes

#### Use Cases for AdminStudio

**Best Fit** (NOT Project 002):
- **Large Enterprises**: 500+ application portfolios requiring continual readiness
- **Multi-Tenant Organizations**: Global enterprises with regional packaging teams
- **Automation-First**: Organizations with mature DevOps practices and CI/CD pipelines
- **Application Rationalization**: Enterprises needing portfolio analysis and retirement workflows

**Poor Fit** (Project 002 Characteristics):
- **220 Application Portfolio**: Below optimal scale for AdminStudio (designed for 500+)
- **Budget Constraint**: £231K project budget cannot accommodate $42K-$60K licensing (£34K-£48K)
- **18-Month Timeline**: Insufficient time for 120-hour AdminStudio training + workflow setup
- **Cloud-Native Focus**: InTune-first deployment model; AdminStudio strengths are in SCCM integration

#### 3-Year TCO (AdminStudio Professional - 3 Licenses)

**Assumptions**:
- 3 Professional licenses at $14,162.83 each (3-year subscription)
- 220 applications to package (65 MSIX, 143 Win32, 12 App-V migration)
- **50% time savings** vs. manual tools (30 min vs. 60 min per app) due to automation
- Packaging engineer salary: £55K/year (£28/hour)
- Training: 120 hours (£3,360) in Year 1

**Cost Breakdown**:

| Year | Applications | Engineer Hours (50% savings) | Labour Cost | Tool Cost (3 licenses) | Training | Annual Total |
|------|--------------|------------------------------|-------------|------------------------|----------|--------------|
| Year 1 | 220 apps × 30 min | 110 hours | £3,080 | $42,488 (£34,000) | £3,360 | £40,440 |
| Year 2 | 50 updates × 30 min | 25 hours | £700 | £0 (included in 3-year) | £0 | £700 |
| Year 3 | 50 updates × 30 min | 25 hours | £700 | £0 (included in 3-year) | £0 | £700 |
| **3-Year Total** | 320 packages | **160 hours** | **£4,480** | **£34,000** | **£3,360** | **£41,840** |

**Note**: After Year 3, licenses expire. Must repurchase $42,488 (£34K) for another 3-year term.

**ROI Calculation**:

- **Manual Packaging Cost (3-year)**: £13,552
- **AdminStudio Cost (3-year)**: £41,840
- **Net Cost**: +£28,288 vs. manual approach
- **Cost Premium vs. Advanced Installer**: +£14,448 (£41,840 vs. £27,392)

**Payback Analysis**: AdminStudio saves 160 hours (£4,480) vs. manual, but costs £34K in licensing. **Payback never achieved** within 3-year project lifecycle due to high licensing cost relative to portfolio size.

**Recommendation**: **Do not adopt AdminStudio for Project 002**. Reasons:
1. **Cost-Prohibitive**: £41,840 (3-year) exceeds 18% of £231K project budget
2. **Over-Engineered**: Designed for 500+ applications; Project 002 has 220 apps
3. **Timed Subscription Risk**: Vendor lock-in with 3-year repurchase requirement
4. **Training Overhead**: 120 hours training competes with Month 2 delivery deadline
5. **Better Alternatives**: Advanced Installer provides 90% of capabilities at 35% of cost (£27K vs. £42K)

**Alternative Use Case**: Consider AdminStudio if Project 002 expands to 500+ applications OR if organization standardizes on AdminStudio for multi-project enterprise licensing.

|--------|---------------|---------------|-------------|---------|------|-----------------|
| **Build** (Microsoft Free Tools) | £13,552 (30% = 9.0) | 1 week (25% = 6.25) | Low (20% = 2.0) | Medium (15% = 2.25) | Low (10% = 1.0) | **20.5 / 30** |
| **Buy** (Advanced Installer) | £27,392 (30% = 6.0) | 2 weeks (25% = 5.0) | High (20% = 4.0) | High (15% = 3.75) | Medium (10% = 0.5) | **19.25 / 30** |
| **Buy** (AdminStudio) | £41,840 (30% = 3.0) | 6 weeks (25% = 2.5) | Very High (20% = 5.0) | Very High (15% = 4.5) | High (10% = 0.0) | **15.0 / 30** |

**Scoring Methodology**:
- Cost: Higher scores for lower costs (£13K = 9.0, £27K = 6.0, £42K = 3.0)
- Time to Value: Faster = higher score (1 week = 6.25, 2 weeks = 5.0, 6 weeks = 2.5)
- Scalability: Future-proofing for 500+ apps (Low = 2.0, High = 4.0, Very High = 5.0)
- Quality: Defect reduction and automation (Medium = 2.25, High = 3.75, Very High = 4.5)

### 3.2 Test Base for Microsoft 365 (Automated Testing)

**Service**: Microsoft Test Base for Microsoft 365
**Cost**: Consumption-based (Azure pay-as-you-go)
**Platform**: Azure-hosted automated testing service
**Documentation**: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/test-base/

#### Description

Test Base for Microsoft 365 is an **Azure-based automated testing service** that validates application compatibility with **pre-release Windows builds** and **monthly Windows updates**. It provides proactive testing before updates are deployed to production devices.

#### Key Features

- **Automated Testing**: Upload application installer; Microsoft automatically tests on pre-release and GA Windows builds
- **Virtual Machines**: Secure VMs provisioned in Microsoft-managed Azure environment (no infrastructure setup required)
- **Pre-Release Testing**: Test applications with Windows 11 Insider Preview builds before public release (3-6 weeks advance notice)
- **Continuous Testing**: Automated regression testing with every monthly Windows update (Patch Tuesday)
- **Test Reports**: Automated pass/fail reports with screenshots, logs, and error details
- **Integration**: API integration with Azure DevOps and Microsoft Endpoint Manager

#### Use Cases

**Best Fit**:
- **Proactive Compatibility**: Test applications with Windows 11 24H2 before it releases to production
- **Patch Tuesday Validation**: Ensure monthly Windows updates do not break applications
- **Regression Testing**: Automated validation that packaged applications still work after OS updates

**Poor Fit for Project 002**:
- **Upfront Testing**: Test Base validates applications with future OS builds, not current Windows 11 compatibility
- **Cost**: Azure consumption charges may exceed budget for one-time compatibility testing (better for ongoing testing)
- **Complexity**: Requires Azure subscription setup and Test Base onboarding (4-6 weeks)

**Recommendation**: **Do not adopt Test Base for Project 002 initial migration**. Test Base is valuable for **post-migration continuous testing** (Year 2+) to validate applications before monthly Windows updates. For initial Windows 11 compatibility testing, use **App Assure** (Tier 1) and **manual VDI testing** (Tier 2/3).

---

### 3.3 VDI Manual Testing (On-Premises Hyper-V)

**Approach**: Build Windows 11 virtual desktop infrastructure (VDI) for manual application compatibility testing.

#### Infrastructure Requirements

| Component | Specification | Cost (One-Time) | Notes |
|-----------|---------------|-----------------|-------|
| **Hyper-V Host Server** | Dell PowerEdge R650 (or equivalent) | £5,000 | 64GB RAM, 2TB SSD, Intel Xeon processor |
| **Windows 11 Enterprise Licenses** | 10 VMs × Windows 11 Enterprise | £0 | Covered by existing Microsoft 365 E5 licenses |
| **Hyper-V Licensing** | Windows Server 2022 Standard | £800 | Includes Hyper-V role |
| **Network Infrastructure** | VLAN configuration, test subnet | £200 | Internal IT team setup |
| **Backup & Snapshots** | Veeam Backup & Replication | £2,000 | VM checkpoint management |
| **Total Infrastructure Cost** | | **£8,000** | One-time capital expenditure |

#### VM Configuration

**Windows 11 Test VMs** (10 concurrent VMs):
- **Base Image**: Windows 11 Enterprise 24H2 (latest GA build)
- **RAM per VM**: 8GB (sufficient for most enterprise applications)
- **Storage per VM**: 128GB (SSD)
- **CPU per VM**: 4 vCPUs
- **Hyper-V Checkpoints**: Snapshot before each test (instant rollback)

#### Testing Workflow

1. **Checkpoint Baseline**: Create Hyper-V checkpoint of clean Windows 11 VM
2. **Install Application**: Deploy application via InTune (simulated) or manual installer
3. **Functional Testing**: Execute test cases from ApplicationTest entity (data-model.md):
   - Launch application → Verify UI renders correctly
   - Execute core workflows (e.g., open document, save file, print)
   - Test application-specific features (e.g., database connectivity, API calls)
   - Validate integrations with other applications (e.g., Outlook, SharePoint)
4. **Document Results**: Record compatibility_status (Compatible, Incompatible, Pending Testing) in Application Catalogue database
5. **Rollback**: Revert VM to checkpoint for next application test (clean state)
6. **Repeat**: Parallel testing across 10 VMs (10 applications tested simultaneously)

#### Throughput Analysis

**Assumptions**:
- 10 concurrent VMs (10 applications tested in parallel)
- 60 minutes per application test (install + functional testing + documentation)
- 8 hours/day testing (7 hours actual testing after setup/breaks)

**Daily Throughput**:
- 7 hours/day ÷ 1 hour/app × 10 VMs = **70 applications/day** (theoretical maximum)
- Realistic throughput: 70 × 70% efficiency = **49 applications/day** (accounting for interruptions, complex tests)

**Timeline for 220 Applications**:
- Tier 1 (66 apps, 30%): 66 ÷ 49 apps/day = **1.5 days**
- Tier 2 (132 apps, 60%): 132 ÷ 49 apps/day = **2.7 days**
- Tier 3 (22 apps, 10%): 22 ÷ 49 apps/day = **0.5 days**
- **Total**: **4.7 days** (approximately 1 week of testing)

**Alignment with Requirements**:
- **BR-002**: "100% of Tier 1 applications tested by Month 2" ✅ Achievable (1.5 days)
- **BR-002**: "95% of Tier 2 applications tested by Month 3" ✅ Achievable (2.7 days)

#### Advantages

✅ **Cost-Effective**: £8K one-time infrastructure vs. £15K/year cloud testing services
✅ **Full Control**: Internal IT team manages VMs; no dependency on third-party services
✅ **Realistic Testing**: Test in environment matching production (InTune policies, corporate network, Azure AD)
✅ **Parallel Testing**: 10 concurrent VMs = 10× throughput vs. single VM
✅ **Reusable Infrastructure**: Post-migration, VMs repurposed for ongoing application testing and troubleshooting

#### Limitations

⚠️ **Manual Effort**: Requires 2 FTE (Application Testers) for 2 weeks = £8,800 labour cost
⚠️ **Infrastructure Setup Time**: 2 weeks to procure server, configure Hyper-V, build base image
⚠️ **No ARM64 Testing**: Hyper-V VMs are x64; requires separate ARM64 device for Copilot+ PC testing
⚠️ **Maintenance**: Ongoing VM patching, Hyper-V host maintenance (4 hours/month = £112/month)

#### 3-Year TCO (VDI Manual Testing)

| Year | Infrastructure | Labour (Testing) | Maintenance | Annual Total |
|------|----------------|------------------|-------------|--------------|
| Year 1 | £8,000 | £8,800 (2 FTE × 2 weeks) | £0 | £16,800 |
| Year 2 | £0 | £2,200 (50 apps × 60 min ÷ 10 VMs) | £1,344 (£112/mo) | £3,544 |
| Year 3 | £0 | £2,200 | £1,344 | £3,544 |
| **3-Year Total** | **£8,000** | **£13,200** | **£2,688** | **£23,888** |

**Recommendation**: **Build VDI manual testing infrastructure** for Tier 2/3 applications. Reasons:
1. **Cost-Effective**: £23,888 (3-year) vs. £45,000 (BrowserStack/cloud testing)
2. **Realistic Environment**: Tests match production InTune policies and corporate network

### 3.4 ARM64 Compatibility Testing (Copilot+ PCs)

**Challenge**: Test application compatibility on ARM64 Snapdragon X Elite/Plus Copilot+ PCs to support Architecture Principle 3A (Copilot+ PC hardware).

#### ARM64 Landscape (2024)

**Copilot+ PC Processors**:
- **Qualcomm Snapdragon X Elite**: 12-core ARM64 CPU, up to 3.8 GHz, 45 TOPS NPU (AI accelerator)
- **Qualcomm Snapdragon X Plus**: 10-core ARM64 CPU, up to 3.4 GHz, 45 TOPS NPU

**Windows 11 on ARM64**:
- **Native ARM64 Apps**: Applications compiled for ARM64 architecture (best performance)
- **x64 Emulation (Prism)**: Windows 11 translates x64 applications to ARM64 in background (Prism emulator)
- **x86 Emulation (Legacy)**: Windows 11 translates x86 (32-bit) applications to ARM64 (slower performance)

**Application Compatibility**:
- **Native ARM64**: Full performance, no emulation overhead (~10% of enterprise apps in 2024)
- **x64 via Prism**: 80-90% native performance for most applications (Microsoft claims "seamless" performance)
- **x86 Legacy**: 60-70% native performance; some apps with game engines, anti-cheat, or kernel drivers may not run

#### Testing Tools & Approaches

##### 3.4.1 Task Manager (Built-in)

**Method**: Use Windows 11 Task Manager to identify application architecture.

**Steps**:
1. Launch application on ARM64 Copilot+ PC
2. Open Task Manager (`Ctrl+Shift+Esc`)
3. Go to **Details** tab
4. Right-click column headers → Select "Architecture" column
5. View application architecture:
   - **ARM64**: Native ARM64 application (optimal)
   - **x64**: Emulated via Prism (good performance)
   - **x86**: Emulated via legacy emulator (reduced performance)

**Advantages**:
✅ **Built-in**: No additional tools required
✅ **Real-Time**: Instant identification during application runtime
✅ **User-Friendly**: Simple GUI for non-technical testers

**Limitations**:
⚠️ **No Automation**: Manual inspection per application
⚠️ **No Performance Metrics**: Does not measure emulation overhead (CPU, memory, battery)

---

##### 3.4.2 IsWoW64Process2 API (Programmatic)

**Method**: Use Windows API `IsWoW64Process2` to programmatically detect application architecture.

**API Function**:
```c
BOOL IsWoW64Process2(
  HANDLE hProcess,
  USHORT *pProcessMachine,
  USHORT *pNativeMachine
);
```

**Return Values**:
- `pProcessMachine`: Application architecture (IMAGE_FILE_MACHINE_ARM64, IMAGE_FILE_MACHINE_AMD64, IMAGE_FILE_MACHINE_I386)
- `pNativeMachine`: Native CPU architecture (IMAGE_FILE_MACHINE_ARM64 for Copilot+ PCs)

**Use Case**: Custom PowerShell or C# script to scan all installed applications and generate ARM64 compatibility report.

**Advantages**:
✅ **Automated**: Script all applications on Copilot+ PC
✅ **Accurate**: Directly queries Windows process architecture

**Limitations**:
⚠️ **Developer Skills Required**: Requires PowerShell/C# scripting expertise
⚠️ **No Performance Testing**: Only identifies architecture, not emulation performance

---

##### 3.4.3 Prism Emulator (Automatic)

**Method**: Windows 11 Prism emulator automatically translates x64 applications to ARM64 in background.

**How Prism Works**:
1. User launches x64 application on ARM64 PC
2. Windows 11 detects application is x64 (not native ARM64)
3. Prism emulator translates x64 machine code to ARM64 on-the-fly
4. Translated code is cached for future launches (reduces startup time)
5. Application runs with 80-90% native performance

**Microsoft Performance Claims** (2024):
- "Seamless x64 emulation with Prism" - most applications run without user noticing emulation
- Photoshop, Chrome, Teams, Office all run well on ARM64 via Prism
- Some apps with game engines (Unity, Unreal Engine 4), anti-cheat software, or specific hardware drivers may not run

**Advantages**:
✅ **Automatic**: No user action required; Windows handles emulation transparently
✅ **Cached**: Translated code cached on disk for faster subsequent launches
✅ **Broad Compatibility**: Most x64 enterprise applications run successfully

**Limitations**:
⚠️ **Performance Overhead**: 10-20% slower than native ARM64 (battery impact, responsiveness)
⚠️ **Driver Incompatibilities**: Kernel-mode drivers (antivirus, VPNs) may not work
⚠️ **Game Engines**: Some Unity/Unreal Engine apps may crash or have rendering issues
⚠️ **No Automated Validation**: Cannot pre-test applications before deployment; must test manually on ARM64 device

---

#### ARM64 Testing Strategy for Project 002

**Challenge**: Limited automated testing tools for ARM64 compatibility in 2024. Testing requires manual validation on physical ARM64 devices.

**Recommended Approach**:

##### Phase 1: ARM64 Inventory (Month 1)

1. **Vendor Research**: Contact ISVs for ARM64-native versions or compatibility statements
   - Example: Adobe Creative Cloud → Adobe provides ARM64-native Photoshop, Illustrator (2024)
   - Example: Microsoft 365 Apps → ARM64-native since 2021
   - Example: Google Chrome → ARM64-native since 2023

2. **ISV Database**: Document `arm64_compatibility` attribute in Application Catalogue (data-model.md):
   - **Native ARM64**: Vendor provides ARM64-compiled application
   - **x64 Emulated**: Vendor confirms application runs via Prism (no native ARM64 version)
   - **Not Tested**: Vendor has not tested on ARM64; requires Project 002 validation
   - **Incompatible**: Vendor confirms application does not run on ARM64 (e.g., kernel drivers)

##### Phase 2: Manual Testing (Month 2)

1. **Procure ARM64 Device**: Purchase 2× Copilot+ PCs (Snapdragon X Elite) for testing (~£2,000)
2. **Parallel Testing**: Test 20 high-priority applications on ARM64 device alongside VDI x64 testing
   - Priority applications: Tier 1 + highest user adoption (active_users > 500)
3. **Task Manager Validation**: Use Task Manager to identify emulated (x64) vs. native (ARM64) apps
4. **Performance Testing**: Measure application launch time, responsiveness, battery impact
5. **Document Results**: Update `arm64_compatibility` field in Application Catalogue database

##### Phase 3: Pilot Deployment (Month 4)

1. **Pilot Copilot+ PCs**: Deploy 50 Copilot+ PCs to pilot users (Finance, HR, IT departments)
2. **Monitor Performance**: Use InTune Advanced Analytics to track app performance on ARM64 devices
3. **User Feedback**: Collect feedback on emulated app performance (battery life, responsiveness)
4. **Adjust Deployment**: Based on pilot results, decide ARM64 deployment strategy:
   - **Option A**: Deploy Copilot+ PCs only to users with ARM64-compatible applications
   - **Option B**: Continue x64 PC deployment; defer Copilot+ until ARM64 app ecosystem matures (2025-2026)

#### ARM64 Testing TCO (3-Year)

| Year | ARM64 Devices | Testing Labour | Travel/Logistics | Annual Total |
|------|---------------|----------------|------------------|--------------|
| Year 1 | £2,000 (2× Copilot+ PCs) | £1,680 (20 apps × 3 hours @ £28/hr) | £200 | £3,880 |
| Year 2 | £0 | £840 (10 apps × 3 hours) | £0 | £840 |
| Year 3 | £0 | £840 | £0 | £840 |
| **3-Year Total** | **£2,000** | **£3,360** | **£200** | **£5,560** |

**Recommendation**: **Invest £5,560 in ARM64 testing** to validate Copilot+ PC readiness (aligns with Principle 3A). Reasons:
1. **Strategic Alignment**: Copilot+ PCs are strategic direction (AI-powered productivity)
2. **Risk Mitigation**: Early testing identifies incompatible apps before large-scale deployment
3. **Vendor Engagement**: ARM64 inventory drives ISV conversations about native ARM64 versions
4. **Pilot Data**: Month 4 pilot provides real-world performance data for procurement decisions

**Caution**: If pilot results show >20% of applications have poor ARM64 performance, consider **deferring Copilot+ PC deployment to 2026** when ARM64 ecosystem matures.
