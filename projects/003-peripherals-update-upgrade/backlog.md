### Appendix F: Risk and Assumptions

**Key Assumptions**:
1. Project 001 delivers Windows 11 laptops with built-in Windows Hello webcams by Month 8 (Week 34)
2. Vendor contracts negotiated with 15% volume discounts maintained for 12 months
3. Users complete 2-hour e-learning before peripheral deployment (reduces support tickets)
4. Facilities provides monitor arms for users with insufficient desk space (£225K separate budget)
5. Azure AD FIDO2 registration portal operational by Week 4 (Month 1)
6. Supply chain lead times stable at 12-16 weeks (no major disruptions)

**Key Risks** (from risk register):
- **R-001 (Closed)**: Budget overrun - Resolved by phased rollout (£470K Year 1, £482K Year 2)
- **R-002 (Open)**: Supply chain delays - Mitigated with 12-16 week advance ordering, 10% buffer inventory
- **R-003 (Open)**: Vendor product gap - Mitigated with multi-vendor strategy (Dell, Yubico, Logitech, Jabra)
- **R-004 (Open)**: User resistance to ergonomic peripherals - Mitigated with training, traditional keyboard fallback
- **R-005 (Open)**: FIDO2 key loss - Mitigated with 2 keys per privileged user, 24-hour replacement process

**End of Backlog**

---

**Note**: This backlog was auto-generated from Project 003 ArcKit artifacts (requirements.md v2.0, stakeholder-drivers.md v1.0, risk-register.md v1.0). Review and refine with your team before procurement begins. Story points reflect procurement/deployment complexity rather than software development effort. Vendor lead times (12-16 weeks) are critical path dependencies.

**Next Steps**:
1. Review backlog with IT Operations Director and Procurement Manager
2. Initiate vendor contract negotiations (Sprint 1 priority)
3. Validate Project 001 laptop Windows Hello compatibility requirements
4. Confirm budget approvals (£470K Year 1, £482K Year 2 phased)
5. Begin Sprint 1 procurement activities (Week 1)
