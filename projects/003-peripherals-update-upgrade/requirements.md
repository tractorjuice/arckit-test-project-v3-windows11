## Requirement Conflicts & Resolutions

### Conflict C-001: Cost vs. Ergonomic Peripheral Quality

**Conflicting Requirements**:
- **Requirement A (BR-003)**: Low-cost peripherals (<£50/unit) to minimize procurement budget
- **Requirement B (BR-004)**: High-quality ergonomic peripherals (£80-120/unit) to reduce RSI and improve satisfaction

**Stakeholders Involved**:
- **CFO**: Wants low-cost peripherals to minimize £500K budget (cost reduction mandate SD-2)
- **End Users & HR**: Want ergonomic peripherals to reduce RSI sick leave (£24K/year) and improve satisfaction (55% → 85%)

**Nature of Conflict**: Low-cost peripherals (£50/unit) enable standardization for 6,000 users (£300K), but lack ergonomic certification and have higher failure rates (5% vs. 2%). High-quality ergonomic (£100/unit) would cost £600K, exceeding budget by £100K (20% over).

**Trade-off Analysis**:

| Option | Pros | Cons | Impact |
|--------|------|------|--------|
| **Option 1**: Prioritize Cost (£50/unit for all) | ✅ Stay within £500K<br>✅ CFO happy<br>✅ Rapid ROI | ❌ Higher RSI risk<br>❌ Lower satisfaction<br>❌ Higher failure rate (5%) | CFO happy<br>Users frustrated |
| **Option 2**: Prioritize Ergonomics (£100/unit for all) | ✅ Reduced RSI (£24K → £12K)<br>✅ Higher satisfaction (55% → 85%)<br>✅ Lower failure (2%) | ❌ £100K budget overrun<br>❌ CFO frustrated | Users happy<br>CFO frustrated |
| **Option 3**: Tiered Approach (£100 for 1,500 power users, £50 for 4,500 others) | ✅ Balance cost/quality<br>✅ Target ergonomics where needed<br>✅ Within £500K (£375K peripherals) | ❌ Two-tier user experience<br>❌ Standard users may feel undervalued | CFO satisfied<br>Power users happy |

**Resolution Strategy**: TIERED APPROACH (Option 3)

**Decision**: Deploy tiered peripheral strategy with ergonomic peripherals (£100/unit) for power users, developers, and users with existing RSI (1,500 users), and standard plug-and-play peripherals (£50/unit) for knowledge workers (4,500 users).

**Rationale**:
- Power users (developers, analysts, designers) spend 10+ hours/day at desk with intensive keyboard/mouse use, highest RSI risk
- Standard knowledge workers spend 6-8 hours/day, lower RSI risk
- CFO budget constraint satisfied: £375K peripheral cost + £75K contingency + £50K (monitor refresh Year 2) = £500K/year budget

**Decision Authority**: IT Operations Director with CFO approval (budget owner)

**Impact on Requirements**:
- **Modified BR-004**: "Power users (1,500) and users with documented RSI equipped with ergonomic peripherals by Month 12. Standard users equipped with plug-and-play peripherals. Users may request ergonomic upgrade if RSI develops."
- **Modified Budget**: Peripheral procurement allocated as £150K ergonomic (1,500 × £100), £225K standard (4,500 × £50), £75K contingency = £450K Year 1 peripherals
- **Added BR-006**: "Users may submit ergonomic peripheral request via IT support portal with self-reported RSI symptoms (pain scale >5/10). Requests approved by IT Operations Lead and provisioned within 10 business days."

**Stakeholder Management**:
- **CFO**: Committed to £500K budget ceiling maintained. Communicated ergonomic tier investment reduces sick leave £12K/year (£60K 5-year NPV), improving ROI from 40% to 45%.
- **Standard Users**: Communicated ergonomic upgrade available on-request if RSI develops (self-service portal, 10-day turnaround). Training emphasizes proper posture to prevent RSI with standard peripherals.
- **HR**: Committed to monitoring RSI sick leave data quarterly and expanding ergonomic peripheral allocation if RSI rates increase above baseline (120 days/year threshold).

**Future Consideration**: Re-evaluate ergonomic peripheral allocation after 12 months based on RSI sick leave data, user satisfaction results, and ergonomic peripheral request volume (if >10% standard users request upgrade, consider expanding allocation).

### Conflict C-002: Windows Hello Biometric Privacy vs. Security Compliance

**Conflicting Requirements**:
- **Requirement A (NFR-SEC-002)**: Biometric data privacy (GDPR Article 9) requires explicit user consent and ability to opt-out, with alternative authentication available
- **Requirement B (BR-001)**: CISO mandate for 100% Windows Hello enrollment by Month 12 for Zero Trust security compliance (passwordless MFA required for all)

**Stakeholders Involved**:
- **Data Protection Officer (DPO)**: Wants user choice and opt-out capability to comply with GDPR Article 9 (biometric data = special category personal data requiring explicit consent)
- **CISO**: Wants mandatory Windows Hello enrollment to eliminate password-based attacks (phishing, credential stuffing) and achieve Zero Trust security (SD-1)

**Nature of Conflict**: GDPR Article 9 requires explicit consent for biometric data processing, implying users must be able to opt-out of Windows Hello. However, CISO mandate requires 100% enrollment for Zero Trust. If users can opt-out, security posture weakened (users fall back to passwords, creating phishing risk).

**Trade-off Analysis**:

| Option | Pros | Cons | Impact |
|--------|------|------|--------|
| **Option 1**: Mandatory Windows Hello (no opt-out) | ✅ 100% Zero Trust compliance<br>✅ CISO security mandate satisfied<br>✅ No password attacks | ❌ GDPR Article 9 compliance risk<br>❌ DPO concerned<br>❌ User choice removed | CISO happy<br>DPO concerned<br>Legal risk |
| **Option 2**: Optional Windows Hello (user opt-out) | ✅ GDPR Article 9 compliant<br>✅ DPO satisfied<br>✅ User choice preserved | ❌ <100% enrollment (80-90%)<br>❌ CISO security posture weakened<br>❌ Password attacks still possible | DPO happy<br>CISO frustrated<br>Security gap |
| **Option 3**: Mandatory biometric, but allow FIDO2 fingerprint as alternative to facial | ✅ 100% biometric authentication<br>✅ User choice (facial or fingerprint)<br>✅ GDPR compliant (alternative provided) | ❌ Additional cost for FIDO2 fingerprint readers (£30/unit × 900 users estimated 15% = £27K)<br>❌ Complexity (two biometric methods) | CISO satisfied<br>DPO satisfied<br>Budget increase |
| **Option 4**: Mandatory Windows Hello with GDPR-compliant consent workflow and DPIA | ✅ GDPR Article 9 compliant (explicit consent)<br>✅ 100% enrollment (users consent, no opt-out)<br>✅ DPIA demonstrates necessity/proportionality | ❌ Users may feel pressured<br>❌ Legal review required (2-week delay)<br>❌ Consent workflow adds friction | CISO satisfied<br>DPO satisfied<br>UX slightly degraded |

**Resolution Strategy**: INNOVATE (Option 4 with fallback to Option 3)

**Decision**: Implement Windows Hello with GDPR-compliant consent workflow (mandatory consent before enrollment, DPIA demonstrating necessity for Zero Trust security), with FIDO2 fingerprint readers available as alternative biometric method for users who refuse facial recognition.

**Rationale**:
- GDPR Article 9 allows biometric data processing if "necessary for reasons of substantial public interest" and "appropriate safeguards" are in place. Zero Trust security qualifies as substantial public interest (protecting organization and employee data from cyber attacks). Storing facial data locally on TPM 2.0 qualifies as appropriate safeguard.
- DPIA (Data Protection Impact Assessment) conducted by DPO demonstrates necessity (Windows Hello eliminates password-based attacks responsible for 80% of breaches), proportionality (facial data stored locally on TPM 2.0, never cloud), and legitimate interest (protecting organization/employee data outweighs privacy concern).
- Explicit consent workflow: User presented with consent dialog during Windows Hello enrollment explaining data usage (local TPM storage only), retention (deleted when user deletes enrollment), and user rights (delete enrollment anytime via Settings).
- Alternative biometric method: Users who refuse facial recognition offered FIDO2 fingerprint readers (£30/unit, estimated 15% uptake = 900 users = £27K funded from contingency).

**Decision Authority**: CIO (Executive Sponsor) with DPO and CISO co-approval

**Impact on Requirements**:
- **Modified BR-001**: "All users must be enrolled in Windows Hello (facial recognition) or FIDO2 fingerprint authentication by Month 12. Users who refuse facial recognition provided FIDO2 fingerprint readers at no cost."
- **Added NFR-SEC-002A**: "Windows Hello enrollment workflow must display GDPR Article 9 consent dialog explaining biometric data usage (local TPM storage), retention (deleted when enrollment deleted), and user rights (delete enrollment anytime). User must click 'I Consent' to proceed."
- **Added NFR-C-001A**: "Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA) must be completed and approved by DPO before Windows Hello rollout. DPIA must demonstrate necessity (Zero Trust security), proportionality (local TPM storage), and legitimate interest (breach prevention)."
- **Modified Budget**: £27K additional cost for FIDO2 fingerprint readers (900 users × £30/unit), funded from £75K contingency buffer.

**Stakeholder Management**:
- **DPO**: Secured GDPR-compliant consent workflow and DPIA demonstrating necessity/proportionality. DPO approval obtained for mandatory biometric authentication approach. Communicated users can delete Windows Hello enrollment anytime via Settings (right to erasure), and alternative fingerprint authentication available.
- **CISO**: Accepted FIDO2 fingerprint alternative (still biometric MFA, equivalent security to facial). Communicated 100% biometric authentication achieved (facial 85% + fingerprint 15% = 100%), satisfying Zero Trust mandate. Added InTune conditional access policy enforcing biometric authentication (no password-only fallback).
- **Users**: Communicated biometric authentication mandatory for Zero Trust security (protects organization and employee data from breaches). Emphasized user choice between facial recognition (free, built-in) and fingerprint (free FIDO2 reader provided). User training includes data protection explanation (facial data stored locally on device TPM 2.0, never transmitted to cloud, user can delete anytime).

**Future Consideration**: Re-evaluate biometric authentication uptake after 12 months. If >95% users choose facial recognition, FIDO2 fingerprint program can be scaled back (lower ongoing costs). If >20% users choose fingerprint, expand fingerprint reader procurement to reduce per-unit costs (volume discounts). Monitor GDPR regulatory changes: If future guidance requires opt-out capability, fallback to Option 2 (optional Windows Hello with password MFA for users who opt-out).

### Conflict C-003: Dual Monitors vs. Ultrawide Monitor (NEW)

**Conflicting Requirements**:
- **Requirement A (BR-006)**: Provide dual 24" monitors for maximum screen real estate and flexibility (separate displays for different tasks)
- **Requirement B (BR-006)**: Provide single 34" ultrawide monitors for simplified cable management and desk space efficiency

**Stakeholders Involved**:
- **Power Users (Developers, Analysts)**: Prefer dual monitors for task separation (code on one screen, documentation on other)
- **Facilities**: Prefer ultrawide monitors due to limited desk space and reduced cable management complexity
- **IT Operations**: Prefer ultrawide monitors for simplified hardware support (single display vs. dual display troubleshooting)

**Nature of Conflict**: Dual 24" monitors provide more flexibility (independent displays, different orientations) but require more desk space (>120cm width), more complex cable management (2× USB-C or 1× docking station), and higher support complexity (dual display driver issues). 34" ultrawide monitors simplify setup (single cable, less desk space) but lack physical separation between tasks and are more expensive per unit (£350 ultrawide vs. £180×2 = £360 dual 24").

**Trade-off Analysis**:

| Option | Pros | Cons | Impact |
|--------|------|------|--------|
| **Option 1**: Dual 24" for all | ✅ Maximum flexibility<br>✅ Physical task separation<br>✅ Lower cost per user (£360) | ❌ Requires wide desks (>120cm)<br>❌ Complex cable management<br>❌ Higher support tickets (dual display issues) | Users happy<br>Facilities frustrated<br>IT support burden |
| **Option 2**: Ultrawide 34" for all | ✅ Simplified cable management<br>✅ Less desk space (90cm)<br>✅ Lower support complexity | ❌ No physical task separation<br>❌ Slightly higher cost (£350 vs £360)<br>❌ Users may prefer dual monitors | Facilities happy<br>IT Ops happy<br>Users mixed |
| **Option 3**: User choice (dual 24" OR ultrawide 34") | ✅ User preference respected<br>✅ Workspace constraints accommodated<br>✅ Flexibility | ❌ Inventory complexity (2 SKUs)<br>❌ Decision paralysis for users<br>❌ Mixed support (dual vs ultrawide issues) | Users happy<br>Facilities neutral<br>IT Ops slight increase in complexity |

**Resolution Strategy**: USER CHOICE WITH WORKSPACE ASSESSMENT (Option 3)

**Decision**: Provide users with choice between dual 24" monitors (Option A) or single 34" ultrawide (Option B) based on:
1. **User Preference Survey**: Users indicate preference (dual vs ultrawide) with pros/cons decision guide
2. **Workspace Assessment**: IT verifies desk space sufficient for selected option (dual 24" requires >120cm width, ultrawide requires >90cm width)
3. **Default to Dual 24"**: If user does not respond to survey within 2 weeks, default to dual 24" (most popular option in pilot survey: 70% preferred dual, 30% ultrawide)

**Rationale**:
- User productivity depends on satisfaction with monitor setup. Forcing single option creates dissatisfaction for users preferring the other.
- Workspace constraints vary significantly across offices (open office vs. cubicles vs. private offices). Facilities assessment prevents desk space issues.
- Dual 24" and ultrawide 34" have similar cost (£360 vs £350), so cost is not differentiating factor.
- Inventory complexity manageable (2 monitor SKUs vs. 1) given volume (1,360 setups over 2 years).

**Decision Authority**: IT Operations Director with Facilities Manager co-approval (desk space verification)

**Impact on Requirements**:
- **Modified BR-006**: "Users eligible for monitor upgrade complete preference survey (dual 24" vs. ultrawide 34") with Facilities workspace assessment. IT deploys preferred option if workspace permits, otherwise alternative offered."
- **Added FR-007**: "User survey captures preference, workspace assessment confirms desk space, both options provide equivalent screen real estate"
- **Modified Budget**: Monitor procurement allocated as 70% dual 24" (952 setups × £360 = £342K), 30% ultrawide 34" (408 setups × £350 = £143K) = £485K total monitors (Year 1 + Year 2)

**Stakeholder Management**:
- **Users**: Survey includes decision guide showing pros/cons of each option (dual: task separation, flexibility | ultrawide: single cable, less desk clutter). Default to dual 24" if no response to avoid deployment delays.
- **Facilities**: Workspace assessment conducted before deployment. Users in constrained desk spaces (<120cm width) offered ultrawide as alternative. Escalation path for users requiring monitor arms (Facilities budget, not Project 003).
- **IT Operations**: Support documentation created for both dual and ultrawide setups. InTune compliance check verifies correct monitor configuration deployed (prevents user complaints about wrong option).

**Pilot Results**: Pilot survey (50 users) showed 70% preferred dual 24", 30% preferred ultrawide. 10% of users had insufficient desk space for dual monitors, successfully accommodated with ultrawide. Zero complaints about monitor choice process.

**Future Consideration**: Re-evaluate monitor choice distribution after Year 1 deployment (680 setups). If >90% users select one option, consider standardizing to single SKU in Year 2 to reduce inventory complexity. If workspace constraints affect >20% of dual monitor deployments, proactively offer ultrawide to users with desk width <120cm.

| **Desk Space Required** | >120cm width | >90cm width (more compact) |
| **Flexibility** | ✅ Independent orientation (portrait/landscape) | ❌ Fixed landscape only |
| **Support Complexity** | ❌ Higher (dual display driver issues) | ✅ Lower (single display) |
| **Cost** | £360 (2× £180) | £350 (single unit) |
| **Best For** | Developers (code + docs), analysts (data + reports), users preferring task separation | Users with limited desk space, preference for seamless continuous workspace |

**Recommendation**: Complete user preference survey. If uncertain, default to dual 24" (70% of pilot users preferred). Facilities will assess desk space and may recommend ultrawide if space constrained.
