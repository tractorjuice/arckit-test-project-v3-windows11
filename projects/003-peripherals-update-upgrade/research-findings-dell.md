## Executive Summary

### Research Overview

This research evaluates Dell's peripheral product portfolio as a preferred supplier for Project 003 (Peripherals Update/Upgrade) supporting the Windows 11 Transformation Programme. The research covers webcams, headsets, keyboards/mice, monitors, and USB-C docking stations to meet requirements for 6,000 users across hybrid working, Windows Hello biometric authentication, and ergonomic productivity use cases.

### Key Findings

**Dell Product Availability**:
- **Strong Match**: Webcams (Windows Hello), Headsets (Teams-certified), Monitors (24"/27" FHD/QHD)
- **Moderate Match**: Keyboards/Mice (wireless USB-C available, but limited ergonomic options)
- **Deferred Items**: USB-C Docking Stations (out of Year 1-2 scope, but Dell WD19S/WD19TBS available for Year 3)
- **Gap**: FIDO2 Security Keys and Fingerprint Readers (not a Dell core product - need alternative supplier)

**Pricing Summary** (estimated per unit, excluding volume discounts):
- Webcams: £170-200 (Dell UltraSharp WB7022 4K)
- Headsets: £130-180 (Dell Pro Plus Wireless ANC WL5024)
- Keyboards & Mice: £80-200/kit (Dell Pro Plus KM7321W £80, Dell KM900 £200)
- Monitors: £90-230 (Dell SE2425HM £90-110, Dell P2425H £160-180, Dell U2424H £230)
- Docking Stations: £150-250 (Dell WD19S £150-180, Dell WD19TBS £200-250)

**3-Year TCO Estimate** (Year 1 + Year 2 scope from Project 003 requirements):
- **Year 1 Peripherals** (Webcams, Headsets): £1.98M (6,000 webcams @ £180, 3,000 headsets @ £150)
- **Year 2 Peripherals** (Keyboards/Mice): £540K (6,000 kits @ £90 average: 1,500 ergonomic @ £100, 4,500 standard @ £50)
- **Partial Monitors Year 2**: £204K (1,360 monitors @ £150)
- **Total Dell Peripherals (Year 1-2)**: £2.724M

**Recommendation**: **BUY from Dell with Volume Procurement Discount Negotiation**

**Rationale**:
- Dell provides Windows Hello WHQL-certified webcam (WB7022) meeting BR-001 requirement
- Dell Pro Plus headsets are Microsoft Teams Open Office certified meeting BR-002 hybrid working requirement
- Dell offers 3-year warranty with Advanced Exchange Service reducing support burden (BR-003)
- Dell Premier enterprise procurement program enables volume discounts (estimated 10-20% for 6,000+ unit orders)
- Single-vendor standardization simplifies asset management and reduces support complexity (45 SKUs → ~10 Dell SKUs)

**Gaps Requiring Alternative Suppliers**:
- FIDO2 Security Keys (500 units): Yubico or Microsoft recommended (Dell doesn't manufacture security keys)
- FIDO2 Fingerprint Readers (900 units): Yubico Bio Series or Kensington recommended

- ⚠️ Battery life lower than AA/AAA models (2-3 months vs. 36 months), requires charging every 2-3 months

#### Suitability Assessment

**Match to Project 003 Requirements**: ⚠️ MODERATE for Ergonomic Tier (60% match)

**Rationale**:
- Dell KM900 provides **some ergonomic benefits** (20-degree wedge keyboard, contoured mouse) meeting BR-004 partially, but **NOT a true ergonomic keyboard** (no split design, no independent certification).
- Meets FR-002 (USB-C charging) fully, providing rechargeable option without battery replacement costs.
- **Expensive at £200/kit** (£255K for 1,500 power users), straining Year 2 budget (£500K total) when combined with standard keyboards (£275K) = £530K total (£30K over budget).
- **Does NOT meet FR-005 (ergonomic certification)** - no independent ergonomic testing body certification.

**Recommendation**:
- **NOT RECOMMENDED as primary ergonomic solution** due to lack of split keyboard design and certification.
- **Consider alternative ergonomic keyboards** (see Gap Analysis below):
  - **Logitech ERGO K860** (£100-120): Split keyboard, ergonomic certification, vertical mouse included, meets FR-005
  - **Microsoft Sculpt Ergonomic Desktop** (£80-100): Split keyboard, cushioned wrist rest, ergonomic mouse, meets FR-005
- **Use Dell KM900 only if Dell single-vendor requirement outweighs ergonomic certification requirement** (not recommended given Conflict C-001 resolution prioritizes ergonomic health for power users).

### Budget Reconciliation Required

**Issue**: Total Dell peripherals cost £2.532M exceeds Project 003 2-year budget £1.0M by £1.532M (153% over budget).

**Root Cause Analysis**:
1. **Webcams**: Dell WB7022 £180/unit (6,000 = £1.08M) vs. budget assumed £30/unit (6,000 = £180K), **£900K over budget**
2. **Headsets**: Dell WL5024 £150/unit (3,000 = £450K) vs. budget assumed £50/unit (3,000 = £150K), **£300K over budget**
3. **Keyboards & Mice**: Dell KM7321W £70/unit (4,500 = £315K) + Logitech ERGO £120/unit (1,500 = £180K) = £495K vs. budget £240K, **£255K over budget**
4. **Monitors**: Dell P2425H £180/unit (1,360 = £245K) vs. budget £150/unit (1,360 = £204K), **£41K over budget**

**Options to Reconcile Budget**:

#### Option A: Negotiate Higher Volume Discounts from Dell Premier

**Target**: 20-25% volume discount (vs. 10% assumed) for 6,000+ unit order

**Savings Potential**:
- Webcams: £180 → £144-153/unit (20-15% discount) = £162-918K savings
- Headsets: £150 → £120-128/unit (20-15% discount) = £66-360K savings
- Keyboards: £70 → £56-60/unit (20-15% discount) = £45-63K savings (standard tier)
- Monitors: £180 → £144-153/unit (20-15% discount) = £37-49K savings

**Total Savings (20% discount)**: £310-1,390K → **Brings Year 1+2 to £1.142-1.222M (still £142-222K over budget)**

**Recommendation**: **Negotiate Dell Premier enterprise contract with 20%+ volume discount** for 6,000+ user order. Dell typically offers 15-25% discounts for enterprise deals (verified via university procurement programs in web research).

#### Option B: Phase Deployment Over 3 Years (Year 1 + Year 2 + Year 3)

**Approach**: Spread peripheral deployment across 3 years to stay within £500K/year budget cap.

**Year 1 (£500K)**: Webcams + Headsets (CRITICAL for Windows Hello BR-001 and hybrid working BR-002)
- Webcams: 6,000 × £144 (20% discount) = £864K ⚠️ **Still £364K over budget**

**Issue**: Webcams alone (£864K) exceed Year 1 budget £500K by £364K.

**Resolution**: **Must negotiate higher discount (30%+) OR reduce webcam scope (deploy to pilot 3,000 users Year 1, remaining 3,000 Year 2)**.

#### Option C: Use Lower-Cost Dell Alternatives or Non-Dell Alternatives

**Webcam**: Replace Dell WB7022 (£180) with **Logitech BRIO 4K** (£130-150)
- **Savings**: £30-50/unit × 6,000 = £180-300K savings
- **Trade-off**: Lose Dell single-vendor warranty integration, but Logitech BRIO also WHQL-certified Windows Hello

**Headset**: Replace Dell WL5024 (£150) with **Jabra Evolve2 30** (£80-100, wired USB-C)
- **Savings**: £50-70/unit × 3,000 = £150-210K savings
- **Trade-off**: Wired (not wireless), but USB-C plug-and-play, Teams-certified

**Keyboards**: Replace Dell KM7321W (£70) with **Logitech MK270** (£25-30, wireless USB)
- **Savings**: £40-45/unit × 4,500 = £180-203K savings
- **Trade-off**: Budget model, but plug-and-play, 36-month battery life

**Total Savings (Alternative Suppliers)**: £510-713K → **Brings Year 1+2 to £1.819-2.022M (still £819K-1.022M over budget)**

**Recommendation**: **Partial alternative suppliers** (use Logitech BRIO webcam saves £180-300K, keep Dell headsets/keyboards for single-vendor benefits).

| | | | | | |
| **Total Year 1 + Year 2** | - | - | - | **£2,064K** | **£1,064K over £1.0M budget** ⚠️ |

**Conclusion**: Even with aggressive cost optimization (Logitech webcam, Microsoft ergonomic keyboards, 20% Dell volume discount), **total cost £2.064M exceeds £1.0M budget by £1.064M (106% over)**.

**Final Recommendation**: **Project 003 budget £1.0M (£500K/year × 2 years) is INSUFFICIENT for comprehensive peripheral upgrade scope**. Recommend one of the following:

1. **Increase Budget to £2.0M** (£1.0M Year 1, £1.0M Year 2) to accommodate realistic peripheral costs for 6,000 users
2. **Phase Deployment Over 4 Years** (£500K/year): Year 1 Webcams (3,000 pilot users), Year 2 Webcams (3,000 remaining) + Headsets (3,000), Year 3 Keyboards/Mice (6,000), Year 4 Monitors (1,360)
3. **Reduce Scope**: Deploy only webcams (£780K Logitech BRIO) + FIDO2 (£54K) in Year 1-2, defer headsets/keyboards/monitors to Year 3-4 with separate budget approval
