## 1. Overview

### 1.1 Purpose

This Requirements Traceability Matrix (RTM) provides end-to-end traceability from business requirements through design, implementation, and testing. It ensures:
- All requirements are addressed in design
- All design elements trace to requirements
- All requirements are tested
- Coverage gaps are identified and tracked

### 1.2 Traceability Scope

This matrix traces:
```
Business Requirements (BR)
  ↓
Functional Requirements (FR)
  ↓
System Components (Design)
  ↓
Test Cases (TC)
```

## 4. Gap Analysis

### 4.1 Requirements Without Design

All 24 requirements have NOT been addressed in HLD or DLD.

**Impact**: The project cannot proceed to implementation without design. Critical project failure.

**Mitigation**: Develop High-Level Design (HLD) and Detailed Design (DLD) documents.

---

### 4.2 Requirements Without Tests

All 24 requirements have NOT been tested.

**Risk**: Untested requirements lead to defects, project delays, and potential security vulnerabilities.
